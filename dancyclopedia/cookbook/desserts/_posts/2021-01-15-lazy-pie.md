1. Play music in the kitchen. [I recommend this playlist.]({{ page.music }})
2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.
3. In a mixing bowl, mix the flour, the sugar, and the baking powder.
4. Lubricate the bottom of a baking tray, and cover it with a thing layer of brad crumbs.
5. Spread evenly a bit more than half of the floury mixture in the tray.
6.  With a spoon, throw the cottage cheese on top of the flour layer and spread it with the back of the spoon. Then chop small fragments of the butter on the top of the cheese.
7. If the cottage cheese is dry, juice it up with sour cream. This step is optional.
8. Spread the rest of the flour mixture on top of the cottage cheese and butter layer.
9. In a mixing bowl, mix two eggs with the milk and the vanilla sugar.
10. Pour the milky liquid on the cake, then use a fork to punch holes on in it all the way to the bottom. This will help the liquid to reach to the bottom of the mixture.
11. Let it rest for at least half an hour, and occasionally scoop the liquid from around the corners and edges and redistribute on top of the pie. You can use a spoon, or just by gently twisting and turning the tray between your hands.
12. In a preheated oven at 150 degrees, bake for 40 minutes.
13. Let it cool down before slicing and serving.
