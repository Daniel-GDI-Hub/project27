1. Play music in the kitchen. [I recommend this playlist.]({{ page.music }})

3. Cut the avocado in half in the longitudinal axis. Take the core out. Cut the halves into quorters, and peal off the skin.
4. Slice up the avocado, and crush the slices with a fork. It does not have to be completely creamy.
5. Finely chop the red onion and remove the inside of the salad tomato after cutting it in half. Chop the tomato meat and its skin into very small bits.
6. Mix all ingredients and season with salt and pepper to your taste.
7. Serve as a dip or on toast.
