Let's see how to cook your chosen dish.

## Ingredients

Here is what you need to have at home.

* 1 litre hot fish stock, made with stock cubes
* 50g butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 300g arborio rice
* 150ml dry white wine
* 6-8 soft sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
* 250g cooked, peeled prawns
* 2 tbsp basil, chopped fresh parsley, or snipped chives
* 50g Parmesan or Italian-style hard cheese shavings

## Preparation

Here are the steps to cook the meal. Enjoy!

1. Start playing music in the background.
2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.

1. Heat the stock in a small pan and keep it gently simmering. 
2. Heat the butter and olive oil in a large pan. Add the onion and garlic, and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring, until softened.
3. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the rice and coat it with the buttery onions. 
4. Add the wine and simmer until almost evaporated.
5. Stir in the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a ladleful of hot stock. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stock has been absorbed into the rice.
6. Continue adding the hot stock a ladleful at a time, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes total or until the risotto is tender and creamy. 
7. For the last 2 minutes of cooking, stir in 250g cooked, peeled prawns and 200g peas (thawed, if frozen, by putting them into a colander and pouring boiling water over). 
8. When the risotto is done, stir in the herbs, then season to taste. 
9. Serve with Parmesan cheese shavings scattered over the top.
