1. Play music in the kitchen. [I recommend this playlist.]({{ page.music }})
2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.
3. Dice the chicken breasts into small pieces, and set it aside.
4. In a bowl for marination, add the soy sauce, mustard, honey, and a few twists of black pepper. Mix them until smooth.
5. Drop the chicken peaces in the sauce, and stir it well. Set it aside in the fridge, while you chop up the broccoli.
6. Cut the flowers of the broccoli of its stem, and cut larger flowers into a half.
7. Choose a baking dish, and  place a baking paper at the bottom of it. Pour a little olive oil in the middle of the paper. One by one, with the cut half, place the broccoli flowers on the oil patch, and spread them in rows, such that the flowers cover the whole tray with small gaps between them.
8. Fill in the gaps with the marinated chicken pieces. Spray a little oil over the top of the content, then cover with foil.
9. Bake for 30 minutes at 180 degrees.
10. Serve with roasted seeds, and a splash of sweet chilly.
