A Croatian classic, which could be classified as comfort food. Quick to make, and it's best to dip bread in the thick tomato sauce. Get ready to lick all your fingers.

1. Play music in the kitchen. [I recommend this playlist.]({{ page.music }})
2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.
3. Finely chop the garlics, and the fresh parsley. Add these to the oil to soften up.
4. Add the bread crumbs to the garlic and parsley. To loosen up the mixture, slowly add a bit of white wine and stir. Gradually add the rest of the wine and boil it.
5. Drop the scampi into the boiling saucepan, and stir for a few minutes.
6. Pour the tomato passata to the cooking scampi and keep stiring. Season with a bit of salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes while stiring so it does not spit tomato everywhere.
7. Serve with bread to dip in the thick sauce.
