# Preparing for the PhD Viva

Notes to help me prepare and deliver the PhD Viva.

## Introductory presentation

Notes on the 10-15 minutes presentation that I will start with, if the examiners would like me to.

#### 1. Title slide

Let's begin with a summary of my thesis, on 

Ultrasonic mid-air haptic technology in context of science communication

#### 2. Thesis in a picture

If I had to use a picture to summarise my topic, this picture would be it.

The illustration of an atom symbolises science.

The hands symbolise touch.

And you can see that the atom is floating in mid-air.

That has always been my motivation. 

I wanted to find a way to touch atoms.

#### 3. Overview

Introduction: objective, approach

Portfolio (on demand): Projects 1 to 5 in 3 parts.

Outcomes: Results, future research, publications, contributions, reflection.

### Introduction

#### 4. Why did I choose the topic of my PhD?

I was interested in science communication.

Scientists can find solutions, but it's society who comes up with problems.

There is a need for a good two-way communication, and trust in science.

Think about vaccines and COVID19.

But how do we trust something we don't see?

Touch makes things more real.

When we don't believe our eyes, or don't know what we see, we first try and touch.

That's how I got interested in the sense of touch.

In particular, mid-air touch, which is a programable interface, enabling the creation of invisible and dynamic tactile sensations.

#### 5. Research scope and the objective

Fields: haptics, science communication, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

Areas: mid-air haptics, audience segments, and multisensory HCI.

Key RQ: How  can engagement between science and society be supported by mid-air haptic technology?

<!--
1. O&C: features, 1 modality - science communicators
2. O&C: characterisation, 3 modalities - disengaged audiences
3. Integrate: multisensory live event - attentive public
4. Integrate: multisensory multimedia experience - sensory impaired public
5. Eval: effectiveness?
6. Apply: formal learning environment - VI or expert audiences.
-->

#### 6. Research approach and summary of methods

Interdisciplinary approach, borrowing both quantitative and qualitative methods from sociology, psychology, haptics, evaluation on the field etc.

Glancing at the summary, we see that I used a wide range of methods.

Methods: Focus groups, online and live surveys, interviews, pilot studies, user studies.

Participant numbers: ranging from just a few, to over a hundred

Participant type: experts, attentive public, sensory impaired people etc

Commonality: triangulation with mixed method, finding the how and why. For example:

Chapter 6: online survey with expert interviews

Chapter 9: quantitative measurement, with interviews.

### Project portfolio

Part 2: Opportunities and challenges of mid-air haptics

#### 7. Project 1: I can feel it moving

Objective: 

Evaluating six design heuristics of

mid-air haptic probes for scientific concepts.

Methods: Qualitative analysis of 

focus groups with science communicators.

Results: Characterisation of mid-air haptic probes

dynamic touch - only 1/6 design features being characteristic

shared experiences (mid-air vs VR),

storytelling, metaphors - similar to mid-air touch in art projects.

#### 8. Figure and video

On this figure, you can see an illustration of the haptic probes we designed. 
But perhaps, it's easier to understand through the video.
Then we can also hear a few of the participant quotes.

If you'd like to take a break from me talking, I'd suggest we watch the video.

#### 9. Project 2: Beyond learning outcomes

Objective: 

Surveying target affective responses (TAR) and 

measuring perceived affective responses (PAR) in 3 modalities.

Methods: Mixed method

Step 1: online survey,

Step 2: expert interviews, and

Step 3: user study comparing 3 interaction modalities.

Results:

List of TAR through rigorous method,

quantitative match scores per interaction modality,

qualitative characterisation of mid-air tactile sensations.

Example: physical touch being playful, mid-air touch creating sense of imagination.

Limitation: Due to covid, only 5 participants.

Next up - Part 3: Integrating mid-air haptics in multisensory experiences

#### 10. Project 3: Dark matter experience

Objective: Integration and evaluation;

of mid-air haptic sensations in live exhibitions for

the attentive public.

Methods:

Practical evaluation methods and observations.

Results: Indicating E. I., predominance

dark matter shadowing the science of the multisensory technology,

challenges in evaluation of overall experience.

#### 11. Figure and video

Here I chose to include the word cloud.
It illustrates that visitors really emphasised the hedonic experience, i.e. enjoyment and interest.
This is what we investigated in Project 2.

If you'd like to take a break from me talking, I'd suggest we watch the video.

#### 12. Project 4: Aquarium of the Pacific

Objective: Integration and evaluation of

mid-air haptic sensations in multimedia content for

sensory impaired audiences.

Methods: 3 work packages

WP1: Interviews for VH or AH preference

WP2: cognitive absorption measurements.

WP3: public feedback

Results: Preference for VH match,

with haptics, more absorbed, more enjoyable,

role reversal suggested.

Limitation: Again, no on-site evaluation method, only in WP2.

Opinion: Great to have commercial initiatives like this for inclusion

Onto part 4: Mid-air haptics in formal science communication

#### 13. Project 5 (overview): Mid-air haptic rendering of shapes with a dynamic tactile pointer

My personal favourite project.

Includes many valuable aspects.

First, academic research:

The basics of DTP rendering

thorough in-lab research project.

Will come to details on the next slide.

Second, research in industry:

Optimising DTP rendering

research placement with Ultraleap Limited.

Third, potential application:

Assistive technology in formal learning environments, 

e.g. at academic conferences or schools

see Eurohaptics '20 demo.

Fourth, public engagement:

Engaging families at WonderFest '19 --

learning about touch and sound.

#### 14. Project 5: Single-stroke and multi-stroke DTP rendered shapes

DTP - The dynamic tactile pointer.

Testing hypothesis arising from project 1.

Objective: 

Develop and evaluate a novel method of mid-air haptic rendering of geometric information.

Methods: Mixed approach

Quantitative measurements - accuracy of recognition, self-reported confidence;

qualitative analysis: interviews on strategy and descriptions.

Results: 30% increased accuracy of shape recognition; 

significantly higher confidence

effects of haptic strokes and chunking - qualitative result

comparable to other haptic interfaces.

#### 15. Figure and video

On the figure, you can see an illustration of the difference between a shape rendered using a single-stroke, and a multi-stroke DTP pattern.

If you'd like to take a break from me talking, I'd suggest we watch the video.

#### 17. What would I study, if I were to do a post-doc?

Arguably, this PhD is more of an exploratory research rather than an in-depth investigation.

But one of the outcomes is the identification of a few research directions, that this niche field of mid-air touch facilitated science communication could advance towards.

For example:

1. Predictive modelling of attitude shifts - based on the AEIOU and attitude models.
2. Mid-air touch augmented tactile graphics - benefits, limitations, addressing known challenges
3. Developing methods of evaluation for technological multisensory experiences.

#### 18. Publications

5 publications in total: 

Prestigious journals and conferences: Frontiers, IEEE Transactions on Haptics, CHI...

3 first author (2 journal, 1 demo)

A second, and fourth author (journal and case study).

Both empirical research contribution and practical insights.

#### 19. Contributions: What did I learn?

I feel this thesis makes a two-fold contribution to the fields of haptics and science communication.

Firstly, by characterising ultrasonic mid-air haptic technology in the context of public engagement with science  objectives, and the needs of different audiences.

Secondly, by developing and verifying a more effective method of rendering mid-air haptic sensations, capable of conveying information relevant to scientific concepts. 

For example, I found that mid-air haptics can be characterised as a technology playing a role in stimulating the sense of imagination, in contrast to physical touch.

We can also characterise mid-air haptics as a convenient platform to facilitate shared experiences between multiple users, in contrast to a more isolating experience of VR.

Secondly,I developed a better way of rendering tactile 2D shapes in mid-air.

This has implications for various application areas.

Such as accessibility of classroom learning, or usability of haptic interfaces.

#### 20. Reflection

I'd also like to reflect a little on the overall PhD experience.

It was more than a few papers, projects, contribution.

I used to say "I'm a doctoral researcher".

But towards the end, I started to say "I'm a PhD student".

Even though we may have a taster of research, make a small contribution, for me it's all about the learning.

Knowledge: science communication, haptics, psychology and sociology.

Approach: research methods, working with people, qualitative insights.

Skills: computer, peer reviewing and publishing, analysis and reasoning.

Personal: changing scientific identity and views on living life.

#### 21. One touch of nature makes the whole world kin

I'd like to end the introductory presentation here with this quote.

One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.

If we could touch not only the visible and touchable things in nature, but also the imperceptible phenomena, perhaps science would become less scary for people.

Thank you, I'll stop here and let you ask questions.

## General questions

Notes on general questions about the overall PhD experience, and some key research aspects.

### Set 1: My research and thesis

#### Why is your subject important?

Usually, the first thing we do when we do not believe our eyes, or can not decide what we see, is that we try to touch that thing.
There are many things proposed by modern science, which we can not see, can not perceive.
If we don't perceive something, it's more difficult to believe in it.
And if we don't believe what scientists say, then it hinders the interaction and progress between science and society.
I believe it is important to find ways to make imperceptible natural phenomena perceivable through sensory technology.
It's important to understand how we can make real things, actually feel real.
We can only achieve this if we study how science and society interacts, how technology can stimulate our senses, and how it affects people's perception of our environment.

#### What is original about your work?

I see two aspects which are original about my work.
Firstly, that most of the haptics research I've seen in context of science, is to do with formal science education, science instruction, and how haptics affects the learning performance.
In contrast, I focused on informal science learning.
I studied how haptics affects the overall experience of "learning about" and not just "learning" science.
This experience is not limited to only school age students, but a much wider range of audiences, who may want to learn about science.

Secondly, I studied a technology that was first described in 2008, and commercialised in 2013.
It's a very novel haptic technology, which has not yet been explored in context of science communication.
Let it be formal learning, or informal learning.

#### What are the limitations of your study?

Since I studied a research area on the intersection of a relatively new academic discipline of science communication, and a new haptic technology, there was little existing knowledge to build on.
Hence, my study is more exploratory, much broader than I imagine most PhD research is.
I studied the overall opportunities and challenges of the technology as viewed by experts.
I studied how the technology can be integrated in a multisensory setup.
I studied how the technology could be used in a formal learning environment.
I studied abled and disabled audiences.
So the limitation is that my individual studies could not investigate a single narrow question very deeply.
For example, I could have spent the whole PhD on the topic of chapter 9 alone.

#### What would you do differently if you were to start your project again today?

Having an idea of what the limitations of my study are, I think I would now define a much narrower research focus.
For instance, I would only research mid-air haptic shape recognition, optimisation of haptic rendering.
Maybe I would only focus on vision impaired participants.
But of course this is because I already know what we found out in the past three years.
I had to carry out all the studies to, now be able to see in hindsight what the limitations are and how I could have done a more specific contribution.

#### What are the pros and cons of the methods you used?

The pros of my mixed method approach is that some of my results can more accurately be interpreted.
For example, in the shapes project, I've used quantitative methods of two kinds: measured and self reported, and a qualitative method of interviews and content analysis.
Quantitative data helped me answer which of the two methods of haptic rendering is more effective.
However, the qualitative data showed why the multi-stroke DTP rendering is more effective.

This is generally true across all the projects.
For example in chapter 6, I used a survey to find relevant linguistic descriptors of target affective responses in science communication.
However, it was the qualitative method, which helped me finalise the results, and better understand why some descriptors were more relevant than others.

In my view, the cons of my methods are rooted in the number of participants recruited.
It was necessary to work with human participants in my studies.
Sometimes with specialists, sometimes with disabled people, sometimes in a public setting.
This meant that I was unable to recruit a large number of participants.
This is a concern when it comes to the validity of my findings, especially qualitative data.
One might ask, if I recruited ten times the number of specialists, or disabled people, would I have found the same results?

#### What are the strongest elements of your research?

I believe that there are two strong elements in my research, that we can highlight.
First, an overall strength, where I combine the knowledge, and research methods of three modern, and in itself interdisciplinary fields: haptics, HCI, and science communication.
This is a strength, because modern science cannot, or should not separate it's fields.
Just like we cannot separate the mind and the body when looking at somebody's health, we can not separately look at the engineering of a computer, and the psychology of its user.
In my research, I bring together social science, psychology, technology research, physiology and so on.

Secondly, I believe the content on mid-air shape recognition is one of the specific, strongest elements in my research.
This project followed the scientific method of observation, hypothesis, experimenting, theory, and verification.
I used both quantitative methods, qualitative data to draw my conclusions.
As I've seen in practice, my findings could be directly applied in product development within industry.

#### What are the weakest parts of your thesis?

Although, I'm passionate about practical work, and research with impact, I think the chapter on the dark matter experience is the weakest link in the chain of my thesis.
I am really proud we could design and host two live events in the science museum of London.
It was great to engage hundreds of people, young and old, with an abstract concept such as dark matter, using multisensory technology 
However, this chapter is more about evaluation of an ecologically valid experience, rather than a rigorously studied research project.
We did not follow the typical scientific method to draw conclusions.

#### What did you learn during your PhD?

I would like to break down this question to two parts.
To what I learnt with regards to my research area, and with regards to my personal development.

With regards to my research area, I would say I learnt that the technology can support both formal and informal science communication, according to the needs of various audiences. It is not an either or technological solution for classroom vs museum, or abled vs disabled audiences.
There is some concern about mid-air haptics, because of what it feels like.
Mid-air haptic sensations can be quite blurry to make out specific patterns.
Mid-air haptic sensations exert very little force on the user, so can be missed easily, unlike some other haptic stimulation.
Also, the commercial vision is to bridge the gap between the digital and physical world, by inserting a tangible interface between the two.
The "novelty factor" is not something a technology can afford to rely on.
So there is much concern about the usefulness about the technology.
But my research showed a few different positive things.
First, that in some application areas, such as science communication, where the nature of interaction is usually a one off, or short occasion, the "novelty effect" may be just enough to achieve science communication goals with the help of the technology.
I've also learnt that, for example, shape recognition can be increased from 50% to over 80%, just by changing the way we approach the problem.
This is comparable to other haptic technologies' performance.
Much research will be needed from many different perspectives of mid-air haptics, but my studies taught me that in 30-40 years, mid-air haptics may well be all around us.

With regards to my personal development, I also learnt many things during my PhD.
I learnt many computer skills I did not have in the past.
I learnt a lot about the sense of touch, and the social science of science communication.
I learnt how to do research with people, and not just numbers and equipment.
I learnt a lot about the scientific community, and practices, such as academic publishing, research dissemination and impact, or collaborations.
This PhD was as much about my personal development, than about making scientific contributions to the research community.

### Set 2: Personal motivation, reflection, contribution

#### Did your PhD go as you had expected?

To some extent yes. I achieved some of my goals.
I've learnt new skills, and improved existing ones, which I lacked after my undergraduate education, but still  found valuable to know.
I tried what is it like to do research, participate in academic publishing, and test ideas.
I learnt about the sense of touch, science communication, while I earned income.

Some things did not go to plan though.
I expected I will design high fidelity haptic simulations of natural phenomena, and study how people will engage and learn from these haptic simulations.
I also expected that I will be comparing mid-air haptic technology directly with other tangible technologies.

In contrast, it proved much more challenging to develop haptic sensations for the hardware than I expected, thus I was limited by what's realistically possible to develop for the device, and I had to rely on collaborations to get support with programming.
Even though I could have researched other haptic technologies in contrast to mid-air haptics, our lab and support network primarily worked with mid-air haptics, thus I would have been left to my own if I wanted to explore unfamiliar equipment.

However, I do not mind that my PhD did not go as I imagined.
I've done many things I did not anticipate.
I carried out research in the lab, practical work in the field, studied different audiences, and different applications of mid-air haptics, such as an experiential interface, or a device to convey information.

#### What is your thesis about?

My thesis is a discussion on the opportunities and challenges of engaging people with learning about science through the use of mid-air haptic technology.
This thesis brings together three multidisciplinary fields: Science Communication, Haptics, and Human-Computer Interaction.

Five projects form part of this thesis, in which both empirical research and practical work has been carried out.
Multiple audience types were studied in the individual projects, which investigated the effectiveness of the technology across three major aspects: 

1. leveraging the spectrum of haptic interaction,
2. creating multisensory experiences of engaging with science in ecologically valid environments, and
3. conveying specifically intended scientific information.

#### How did you develop an interest in your subject area?

During my undergraduate degree, I studied physics.
I always wanted to understand the fundamental building blocks and laws of nature, where we as human species have evolved.
However, by the end of the degree, it became even more important to communicate what science is, and what it offers to those who are not actively involved in science.

In parallel to this, I was thinking about how we could use tactile pixels to create digital, refreshable tactile graphics for vision impaired people, who want to learn about science, or simply use diagrams, graphs.
These two feelings made me curious in general about the role of touch in science communication.

#### What prompted you to choose this PhD?

I participated in my supervisor's study, where I first experienced mid-air haptics.
I thought, this is the technology I wanted to invent.
Well, it was already invented a few years in advance, but little has been known about the applications of the technology, so I wanted to study how I could use it to communicate science.
My supervisor contacted the company with my PhD proposal, and they agreed to fund it.

#### Why have you organised your chapters the way you did?

Since, the thesis brings together multiple interdisciplinary fields, it was necessary to provide context in Part I.
I wanted to introduce my motivation, research questions, and research approach, before writing a systematic literature review on the two main topics I studied.
 
The chapters in the main body get progressively more specific.
Chapter 5 is starting from design heuristics, and relies on qualitative methods only to explore opportunities and challenges identified by science communicators with regards to mid-air haptics.
In this project, I left the exploration open within the entire AEIOU framework.
I also explored three different scientific topics.

Chapter 6 is more specific in a sense that I reduced the scope of the study to only the "E" and "I" dimensions of the AEIOU framework.
I also brought in more quantitative measures to be more specific in the findings.
Specific linguistic descriptors were studied, and a specific quantity of "match score" for two different touch modalities.
Only one science topic was used instead of three.
But both chapter 5 and 6 was studying touch as a unimodal interaction channel.

Chapters 7 and 8 also studied single, specific science concepts.
These chapters however, study a multimodal integration of mid-air touch.
The reason why chapter 8 follows chapter 7 and not the other way around, is because chapter 8 studies the technology in context of audiences with special needs, instead of a general audience.

Finally, chapter 9 links to the audience of vision impaired users partly studied in chapter 8.
However, chapter 9 moves away from studying the overall experience, and explores how mid-air touch could be used to convey specific information, that is geometric shapes.
This final chapter also transitions into the discussion of formal science communication, instead of informal science communication, discussed in the previous four chapters.

#### Where are you planning to publish your work?

I'm quite proud of the diversity of my existing publications.
I've got two journal papers in leading journals of HCI and haptics.
For example, the work from chapter 5 was published in Frontiers in Computer Science (Human Media Interaction), and the content of 
Chapter 9 was published in Transactions on Haptics.

I also published the work in chapters 7 and 8 in a leading conference venue of HCI (CHI '20) and as a practical insight in the Journal of Science communication.
If I will publish in the future, I will most likely aim to target these journals, amongst some other high impact venues I'm aware of.

#### Where do you see your research going in the future?

From the industry perspective, I see that Ultraleap Limited has followed up on my work from chapter 9.
The method of haptic rendering I studied is a valuable contribution to the recognisability of haptic icons.
This has a wide range of applications in various consumer electronic markets.
However, much more research is needed to fully optimise the multi-stroke dynamic tactile pointer method of rendering haptic sensations.
Just like I worked on this research project with Ultraleap as an intern, I expect they will continue researching this topic.

With regards to academia, there is research opportunity in following up on topics of accessibility through mid-air haptics, on predictive modelling of haptic experiences in public engagement venues, or simply researching effective methodologies of evaluating haptic experience in the context of science communication.

#### What original contribution to knowledge have you made?

I feel this thesis makes a two-fold contribution to the fields of haptics and science communication.
Firstly, by characterising ultrasonic mid-air haptic technology in the context of public engagement with science  objectives, and the needs of different audiences.
Secondly, by developing and verifying a more effective method of rendering mid-air haptic sensations, capable of conveying information relevant to scientific concepts. 

For example, I found that mid-air haptics can be characterised as a technology playing a role in stimulating the sense of imagination, in contrast to physical touch.
We can also characterise mid-air haptics as a convenient platform to facilitate shared experiences between multiple users, in contrast to a more isolating experience of VR.

My second contribution, simply put, is a better way of rendering tactile 2D shapes in mid-air.
This has implications for various application areas, such as accessibility of classroom learning, or usability of haptic interfaces.
