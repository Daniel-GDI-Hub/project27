<h2 id="volunteering-opportunities">Volunteering opportunities</h2>

<p>Currently, the following specific roles and jobs are waiting for you to take.</p>

<h3 id="1-web-stylist---a-k-a-bootstrap-guru">1. Web stylist - a. k. a. Bootstrap guru</h3>

<p>I just about managed to link up Bootstrap, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages, to kick in the Project27 engine.
However, I haven’t really spent time working on the visual appeal of the site yet.
In part, this is because I can not see the effect of any change I’d do.
In part, because Bootstrap scares me. So really, the site would benefit from the capable hands of a web stylist, tinkering on visual design.</p>

<h4 id="who-am-i-looking-for">Who am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Somebody, who</p>

<ul>
  <li>wants to get into web design and learn Bootstrap for styling;</li>
  <li>has a creative and artistic mindset;</li>
  <li>catches onto a challenge, and doesn’t let it go until the challenge is solved.</li>
  <li>can learn and problem solve independently, though there will be room for collaborative learning and working.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-am-i-looking-for">What am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Some of the ToDo items that I’d happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating a unique, and consistent character of the site, by:
    <ol>
      <li>populating content with graphical icons, and figures;</li>
      <li>designing and implementing a global colour scheme;</li>
      <li>designing and implementing the type and visual style of UI elements;</li>
      <li>improving the layout of the content.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>enhancing accessibility and usability, by:
    <ol>
      <li>making sure accessibility, and usability are kept in mind when designing the visual styling. For example:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>graphical elements have suitable alternative description, ARIA labels are informative, and UI elements use standard HTML syntax compatible with screen readers.</li>
      <li>The colour scheme has sufficient contrast, and the font size and family is appropriate for low vision users.</li>
      <li>Content layout is convenient to access for people with learning difficulties or motor disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-back-end-engineer---a-k-a-jekyll-guru">2. Back-end engineer - a. k. a. Jekyll guru</h3>

<p>Although I’ve learnt a lot about using Jekyll since the start of Project27, there are a few issues persisting for longer than I’d like them to persist.
I track these issues on GitHub, but so far made little progress about resolving the tickets.
If you can help, please do.</p>

<h4 id="who-am-i-looking-for-1">Who am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Somebody, who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has past experience with Jekyll or Liquid, or learns quickly;</li>
  <li>can solve issues I couldn’t, and happy to teach me.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-am-i-looking-for-1">What am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Some of the ToDo items that I’d happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding Jekyll solutions of issues I track;</li>
  <li>raising new issues, suggestions of optimisation around the Jekyll structure, and the Liquid syntax currently used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-would-i-volunteer-to-contribute-to-project27">Why would I volunteer to contribute to Project27?</h2>

<p><strong>Do it for yourself.</strong></p>

<div class="dropdown">
                <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="b01" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Learn new skills, or improve your existing skills.</a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="b01">
<p>

Project27 is all about learning new skills, and getting better in doing certain things, by practicing, and innovating.
The project offers a wide range of skills to pick up and nurture, and you get to choose which is most valuable to you.
All that Project27 volunteering roles do, is setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) targets for you to work towards.

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dropdown">
                <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="b02" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Use your knowledge and productivity output to help others.</a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="b02">
<p>

In the process of learning, you are also contributing to a shared vision.
You could learn on your own, and practice through your personal project.
Wouldn't it be more satisfying though, to help other people in the process?
There are no deadlines, no punishment if something doesn't work out.
It's learning through trial and error, and practice.

</p>

</div>
<div class="dropdown">
                <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="b03" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Be part of a team.</a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="b03">
<p>

 Vibrant teams maintain a friendly vibe.
 There will be opportunities to be social by both digital and physical ways.
 Turn up for every, or every fifth team checkin.
 Stay for an hour, or drop in for only ten minutes.
 Being socially proactive is not a must, only an opportunity.

</p>

<div class="dropdown">
                <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="b04" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Satisfy your dopamine needs with an extra reward.</a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="b04">
<p>

Are you the collector type, gathering and displaying credits, kudos,, acknowledgements, thanks, and all that jazz?
Then you'll also get the rewards on the <a href="./wall-of-fame.html">public Project27 wall of fame,</a> as well as in the inner circle of Project27.

<h2 id="how-much-time-should-you-commit">How much time should you commit?</h2>

<p>The level of engagement is flexible. You may</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify, or ask me for a single challenge, solve it, and you are done.</li>
  <li>continue working on multiple challenges, whenever you find time, even if only a couple hours in a month.</li>
  <li>get hooked, and if you have nothing better to do, treat it as a part time role.</li>
</ul>
