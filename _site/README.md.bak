 This page introduces the Project27 vision and mission, why it exists, who is behind the content, and what the roadmap of development is. On the small scale, Project27 is a private, digital notebook on a range of topics that matter to the author. It is a hobby activity, an opportunity to learn skills in web development, audio editing, and revising notes on physics. However, there exists a vision on the grand scale too.

### What's the Project27 vision?

**To be the most significant peer reviewed, educational web journal for universally accessible technical content.** 

This vision statement reflects the belief of where Project27 will be in 2050, 30 years after its launch.

In 2050, if a person with vision impairment would like to consume technical content, they will be able to do it anywhere, anytime, without any specialised equipment or preparation. You can compare this with a sighted person today, who sits down on the sofa, brings up the Wikipedia page about special relativity on their internet enabled device, and starts comprehending the content.

For the content to be universally accessible, this will not depend on additional assistive technology or specialised document formats. The quality and ease of use for technical resources, such as mathematical scripture, graphical information, or multimedia content will be no different from the experience of digital materials used by sighted consumers.

This vision requires three things.
First, a standardised, robust, and compatible system of  markup languages for reliable digital language processing, serving multiple solutions of non-visual communication.  
Second, content authoring tools for creating written documents, which are synthesised by existing text-to-speech solutions into natural verbalisations across platforms.  
Third, methods of appending graphical and multimedia content with their non-visual equivalent, such as tabular descriptions of charts, or audio descriptions of video.

Standard and robust markup languages, text-to-speech solutions already exist, but with an inconsistent quality of output, typically mutually exclusive and serving one or another platform, and which require additional tools to process scripts into natural output.
If Project27 finds a way to interface between existing markup languages, develops authoring tools and content through peer review that is ensuring a high standard of quality across multiple platforms, it really can become the most significant educational web journal for universally accessible technical content. 

If this vision is hard to believe in, [watch  the Macintosh introduce itself in 1984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY) using text-to-speech solutions, and how far natural language processing and synthetic speech has developed, to become responsive, naturally speaking [voice assistants present in our homes](http://emosamples.syntheticspeech.de). Also, remember that the widely used markup language - [TeX](https://www.tug.org/whatis.html) - was developed throughout the 1980s, with a version usable on personal computers by the early 90s, i.e. roughly 30 years ago.

### What's the Project27 mission?

**To deliver content and authoring solutions that remove the barriers between technical resources and methods of non-visual access to information.**

This mission statement is how Project27 intends to make its vision come true. If the vision is the destination, the mission is the path selected to arrive at the destination.

The first part of the mission statement states how Project27 will become the most significant peer reviewed, educational web journal in 2050.
This is only possible by innovating new solutions that will enable the high quality, universally available experience - set as the target.
Creating a substantial and growing volume of peer reviewed content is what will enable society to adopt the solutions in a wide range of contexts.
Innovation enables the goal, delivery achieves it.

The second half of the mission statement defines the mindset in which solutions should be engineered. Project27 does not want to simply improve the quality of existing solutions, or create a new repository of resources. Innovation should strive to remove those experiential barriers that prevent equi-natural processing of technical resources by methods of non-visual access to information.
Project27 should minimise the gap between perceived experience, when consuming technical content, by a sighted and a vision impaired person.

Unlike the project vision, the mission of Project27, that is the way it achieves its long term vision, will evolve as existing technology and solutions evolve.

### Who is behind Project27?

Hi, my name is Daniel, and the Project27 vision is my vision too. 

I was born in 1994 with healthy eye sight. However, I do not remember what it was like to see perfectly. I was very young when my sight started to deteriorate. By the age of sixteen, I was completely blind. Yet, with invaluable support from family, friends, teachers, innovators and technological advances, I was able to live for my passion - science, and maintaining human relationships.

I graduated as a theoretical physicist. I went on and enrolled to study for a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically haptic interaction, applied to the field of science communication. I am fortunate to have many valuable friends and colleagues. I live independently in England, United Kingdom, and speak english as my second language on daily bases. 

It was not easy to come so far. I consider myself incredibly lucky, and merely clever. I wouldn't be where I am now, without all the support I received, and now it is time for me to start returning the favour for anyone who might benefit from it.

The Project27 blog serves two purposes. First, to log things I learn during the development of this project, which one day may be shaped into a deliverable solution, as defined in the mission statement. Second, through the TWIST series, I'd like to hint a key notion. A person is a set of identities. As a good friend of mine once said, "Daniel, you are 50 shades of Daniel". I want to show that, a scientist is not just a "scientist". A blind person is not just a "blind" person. I want to show, through my journey what any blind person can do if they find the way. A blind person can cook delicious meals, a blind person can study and work in sciences, a blind person can be active in journalism and audio editing. A blind person can also learn to programme, study human psychology, and perform statistical analysis for data science. Some of these life style stories will come through the pipeline of the TWIST blog, and some through scribbles of the Dancyclopedia. 

There is one common aspect of all the content within Project27. If the laws of nature allow it, you can do it. I truly wish that the content, solutions, and spirit will become not only my own, but a shared vision of many. As part of the project, I will follow an open office policy. This means, if you need help doing something and you believe I can help, I will try. The mode of communication will evolve with the project itself. 

So long, all the best!

Daniel Hajas

### What's on Project27?

The project is split into two parts.

* The blog, and
* the Dancyclopedia.

The TWIST blog provides life style articles on living with a vision impairment. The LogBook on the other hand, does what it says. It keeps a log of issues encountered, snippets of problems and solutions while developing the content.

The Dancyclopedia is what I think about as an educational, web journal. Initially, six volumes form part of the journal.

* Mathematical and physical sciences hub;
* Computer literacy hub;
* Haptics hub;
* Statistics hub;
* Cookbook; and
* Vocal.

The Mathematical and physical sciences hub (MPS) is a collection of scribbles on mathematical and physics content, organised into distinct issues, or chapters. This volume exists to develop universally accessible content that relies on the heavy use of mathematical notation and diagrams. We also must understand what the laws of nature allow and forbid to tell whether we can or can not do something. Remember: 
> If the laws of nature allow it, you can do it.

The volume on computer literacy exists to offer a collection of handy tips on how to operate a set of tools, such as git for version control, bash for interacting through shell commands, or RMarkdown to produce accessible reports of statistical analysis. What's common in these scribbles is that they approach the task from the non-visual access point of view. While a high percentage of tutorials describe how to create an RMD report using R Studio (an inaccessible GUI tool), there are not many who give clear instructions on how to do the same through shell commands. These are skills that a blind scientist might find useful. This volume also gives an opportunity to incubate solutions that makes reading computer code a more sophisticated experience for text-to-speech users, for instance auditory syntax highlighting.

The haptics and statistical volumes are a specific set of scribbles on how these two areas of knowledge work, either at the conceptual level, or in practice.

The cookbook volume is nothing more but a collection of recipes. It secured a place because many people live with the assumption that blind people can not cook. Cooking is a passion, and is a great way to nurture human relationships. This volume also serves as a good sandbox for experimenting with semantic language processing. For example, should you hear 10 meters, or 10 minutes when the recipe says cook for 10m?

Finally, the Vocal volume is an album of voices. This is a volume to honour and listen to those who shaped the mixture of identities any one of us is made up of. This volume includes short biographies and recorded interviews with friends and family. The content also gives opportunity to explore solutions around audio editing, techniques of journalism, and the art of listening. All of these can be useful skills for a blind person, even if they do not wish to be part of the science community.

### Where does the Project27 roadmap lead?

The roadmap of this project is split into five year intervals.

#### 2025

 Project27 is a private tool, under construction. No public access is granted. In the first five years, the key characteristics and targets are:

* single author project, with smaller contributions from trusted friends.
* learn basic web development skills, 
* explore solutions and methods around accessible written technical content creation, and
* expand the library of scribbles with written content, external links, and multimedia.

The key performance indicators are:

* A coherent, usable, easy to maintain website architecture is completed;
* a solution is regularly executed and documented for deploying content that is universally accessible on Windows, Mac, and iOS, using automated conversion of markup sources, and clutter cleaner scripts, eliminating the use of any additional need for processing published content;
* every volume, chapter, and blog topic has at least one high quality, complete article;
* KPIs are determined for 2025-2030.

#### 2030

For the second interval of five years, the project is in public beta status to inform its roadmap, potentially introducing a pivot point.

* Two author project: Daniel and a co-editor works together to conform the content and web architecture to public feedback.
* exploration of solutions for appending graphical and video content with their non-visual equivalence;
* expand scribbles in existing volumes, and consider new volumes based on feedback.

#### 2035

Ten years after conception, Project27 transitions from a single author project to a multi-author journal. 

* The CEO oversees the content creation, funding and marketing tasks. The CTO is responsible for quality assurance of the web architecture including accessibility and functionality, as well as exploring new technological solutions in line with the vision and mission statements;
* associate editors are appointed to take care of individual volumes;
* volume content is expanded by the project team, and public feedback based on usage is considered; however, still no public notes are published;
* a system is developed for submitting scribbles by the public, and distributed for peer review.

#### 2035-2050

The web journal opens for public submission of scribbles, which are published after peer review and quality check.

* operation starts as conventional journals with editor, associate editors, reviewers, and authors;
* strategy development for revenue making from tools developed and experiences from the past 15 years;
* journal remains open source.

#### Evolution of contributions

For now, in the first five years, I will explore solutions and write content  on my own. However, eventually, I'd like to have associate editors, who take care of existing content and expand the volume they own. Although one of the key objective at the personal level is to learn web development, I'd like to work with a web developer, occupying the role of CTO, who knows what they are doing and are able to innovate through modern technological solutions. I'm just writing web scribbles and work towards the vision step by step. 

#### Issue tracking

Project27 will track known issues on inaccurate information, as well as known accessibility bugs around the scientific content. This will partly be done through the GitHub repository and the LogBook articles.
