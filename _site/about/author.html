<h2 id="welcome-letter-by-daniel--founder-of-project27">Welcome letter by Daniel – Founder of Project27</h2>

<p>Welcome, my name is Daniel, and the Project27 vision is my vision too.</p>

<p>I was born in 1994 with healthy eye sight. However, I do not remember what it was like to see perfectly. I was very young when my sight started to deteriorate. By the age of sixteen, I was completely blind. Yet, with invaluable support from family, friends, teachers, innovators and technological advances, I was able to live for my passion - science, and maintaining human relationships.</p>

<p>I graduated as a theoretical physicist. I went on and enrolled to study for a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically haptic interaction, applied to the field of science communication. I am fortunate to have many valuable friends and colleagues. I live independently in England, United Kingdom, and speak english as my second language on daily bases.</p>

<p>It was not easy to come so far. I consider myself incredibly lucky, and merely clever. I wouldn’t be where I am now, without all the support I received, and now it is time for me to start returning the favour for anyone who might benefit from it.</p>

<p>The Project27 blog serves two purposes. First, to log things I learn during the development of this project, which one day may be shaped into a deliverable solution, as defined in the mission statement. Second, through the TWIST series, I’d like to hint a key notion. A person is a set of identities. As a good friend of mine once said, “Daniel, you are 50 shades of Daniel”. I want to show that, a scientist is not just a “scientist”. A blind person is not just a “blind” person. I want to show, through my journey what any blind person can do if they find the way. A blind person can cook delicious meals, a blind person can study and work in sciences, a blind person can be active in journalism and audio editing. A blind person can also learn to programme, study human psychology, and perform statistical analysis for data science. Some of these life style stories will come through the pipeline of the TWIST blog, and some through scribbles of the Dancyclopedia.</p>

<p>There is one common aspect of all the content within Project27. If the laws of nature allow it, you can do it. I truly wish that the content, solutions, and spirit will become not only my own, but a shared vision of many. As part of the project, I will follow an open office policy. This means, if you need help doing something and you believe I can help, I will try. The mode of communication will evolve with the project itself.</p>

<p>So long, all the best!</p>

<p>Daniel Hajas</p>
