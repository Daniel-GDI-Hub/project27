 <h1 id="the-grand-ambition">The grand ambition</h1>

<p>However, there exists a vision on the grand scale too.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-grand-project27-vision">What’s the grand Project27 vision?</h3>

<p><strong>To be the most significant peer reviewed, educational web journal for universally accessible technical content.</strong></p>

<p>This vision statement reflects the belief of where Project27 will be in 2050, 30 years after its launch.</p>

<p>In 2050, if a person with vision impairment would like to consume technical content, they will be able to do it anywhere, anytime, without any specialised equipment or preparation. You can compare this with a sighted person today, who sits down on the sofa, brings up the Wikipedia page about special relativity on their internet enabled device, and starts comprehending the content.</p>

<p>For the content to be universally accessible, this will not depend on additional assistive technology or specialised document formats. The quality and ease of use for technical resources, such as mathematical scripture, graphical information, or multimedia content will be no different from the experience of digital materials used by sighted consumers.</p>

<p>This vision requires three things.
First, a standardised, robust, and compatible system of  markup languages for reliable digital language processing, serving multiple solutions of non-visual communication.<br />
Second, content authoring tools for creating written documents, which are synthesised by existing text-to-speech solutions into natural verbalisations across platforms.<br />
Third, methods of appending graphical and multimedia content with their non-visual equivalent, such as tabular descriptions of charts, or audio descriptions of video.</p>

<p>Standard and robust markup languages, text-to-speech solutions already exist, but with an inconsistent quality of output, typically mutually exclusive and serving one or another platform, and which require additional tools to process scripts into natural output.
If Project27 finds a way to interface between existing markup languages, develops authoring tools and content through peer review that is ensuring a high standard of quality across multiple platforms, it really can become the most significant educational web journal for universally accessible technical content.</p>

<p>If this vision is hard to believe in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY">watch  the Macintosh introduce itself in 1984</a> using text-to-speech solutions, and how far natural language processing and synthetic speech has developed, to become responsive, naturally speaking <a href="http://emosamples.syntheticspeech.de">voice assistants present in our homes</a>. Also, remember that the widely used markup language - <a href="https://www.tug.org/whatis.html">TeX</a> - was developed throughout the 1980s, with a version usable on personal computers by the early 90s, i.e. roughly 30 years ago.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-grand-project27-mission">What’s the grand Project27 mission?</h3>

<p><strong>To deliver content and authoring solutions that remove the barriers between technical resources and methods of non-visual access to information.</strong></p>

<p>This mission statement is how Project27 intends to make its vision come true. If the vision is the destination, the mission is the path selected to arrive at the destination.</p>

<p>The first part of the mission statement states how Project27 will become the most significant peer reviewed, educational web journal in 2050.
This is only possible by innovating new solutions that will enable the high quality, universally available experience - set as the target.
Creating a substantial and growing volume of peer reviewed content is what will enable society to adopt the solutions in a wide range of contexts.
Innovation enables the goal, delivery achieves it.</p>

<p>The second half of the mission statement defines the mindset in which solutions should be engineered. Project27 does not want to simply improve the quality of existing solutions, or create a new repository of resources. Innovation should strive to remove those experiential barriers that prevent equi-natural processing of technical resources by methods of non-visual access to information.
Project27 should minimise the gap between perceived experience, when consuming technical content, by a sighted and a vision impaired person.</p>

<p>Unlike the project vision, the mission of Project27, that is the way it achieves its long term vision, will evolve as existing technology and solutions evolve.</p>
