## {{ page.title }}

There exists a vision on the grand scale too.
More people join {{ site.brand }} to learn by getting involved.
The team expands, and new projects are added.
The growth of the library allows more visually impaired and learning disabled people to learn, even if they don't wish to get involved in projects.
The team becomes a community.
The community drives business activities.
The revenue is invested in new research, development, and learning projects.

### What's the grand {{ site.brand }} vision?

**Together we learn, together we teach!**

#### The vision explained

This vision statement reflects the belief of where {{ site.brand }} will be in 2050, 30 years after its launch.

In 2050, if a person with vision impairment would like to consume scientific or otherwise technical and professional content, they will be able to do it as easily, as reading any other content.
They will only need their regular choice of assistive technology.
You can compare this with a sighted person learning in 2020.
Learning can occur, in three easy steps:

1. Jim sits down on the sofa.
2. He brings up the Wikipedia page about special relativity on his phone.
3. He starts learning the theory.

Our vision is to replicate this learning experience for vision impaired learners.
Hence, content will not depend on specialised assistive technology.
People will not need non-standard document formats.

This vision requires three things.

1. Light-weight digital language processing. A system of standardised, robust, and compatible  markup languages.
2. Content authoring tools for creating written documents. These documents are synthesised by existing text-to-speech solutions into natural language across digital platforms.  
3. Methods of linking graphical and multimedia content with their non-visual equivalent, such as accessible data visualisations, or audio descriptions of videos.

<!--
If this vision is hard to believe in, [watch  the Macintosh introduce itself in 1984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY) using text-to-speech solutions, and how far natural language processing and synthetic speech has developed, to become responsive, naturally speaking [voice assistants present in our homes](http://emosamples.syntheticspeech.de). Also, remember that the widely used markup language - [TeX](https://www.tug.org/whatis.html) - was developed throughout the 1980s, with a version usable on personal computers by the early 90s, i.e. roughly 30 years ago.

### What's the grand {{ site.brand }} mission?

**To create tools and a place for learning, driven by a community of learners and teachers, who value accessible learning experiences.**

#### The mission explained

This mission statement is how {{ site.brand }} will make its vision come true.
If the vision is the destination, the mission is the path to our goal.

The first part of the mission statement states how {{ site.brand }} will facilitate learning, teaching, research, and innovation by 2050.

This is only possible by innovating new solutions.
Creating tools, a place for learning, and content will enable the community, and {{ site.brand }} to grow..
Innovation enables the goal, delivery achieves it.

The second half of the mission statement highlights the need for community engagement.
Learning is a social process.
It is an interaction between teachers and learners.
Learners can become teachers.
Individuals can form communities, if their values align.
Our mission is to harness the power of people, who value an accessible learning experience.
They can drive the growth of projects, and teach new learners.

This is a mission in 2022.
The vision should stay the same.
But, the mission of {{ site.brand }},  will change as existing technologies and solutions evolve.
