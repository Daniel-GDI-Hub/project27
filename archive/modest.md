## {{ page.title }}

{{ site.brand }} is a digital, private notebook on a range of topics that matter to Daniel and Danielle. It is a hobby activity. It is an opportunity to learn through doing. We are gaining new skills and lead by example. For instance, we learn:

* web development,
* accessible content creation,
* audio editing,
* physics and statistics,
* capturing and sharing life stories and recipes,
* expressing opinions,

and much more, while we work on projects.

### What's the modest {{ site.brand }} vision?

**Through {{ site.brand }}, 
we tell our stories, and we inspire people living with learning disabilities and sight loss.
We teach, and we remind ourselves how to do things.
We learn by doing, and we involve others in learning.**

### What's the modest {{ site.brand }} mission?

**To develop learning projects, and build an accessible library of notes.**

#### The mission explained

The {{ site.brand }} motto states that the project is

> {{ site.motto }}.

While warehouse is an easier term to relate to, a more appropriate description of the project would be that it is a

> corpus of challenges and solutions.

In dictionary terms, a corpus is

> "a collection of written texts, especially the entire works of a particular author or a body of writing on a particular subject."

In this sense, the mission statement reflects the wish to collect and organise the notes of Daniel and Danielle into a single collection.
We edit and organise the content according to the {{ site.brand }} guidelines.
In the content guidelines, we place special emphasis on best practices in digital accessibility.
Small projects help us to find new, easier ways to make the learning experience inclusive.
