# Project management

The organisation's mission and vision are a collection of themes driven by business goals and market requirements.

Themes are milestones on the roadmap (e.g. 5 year milestones in P27). Roadmap is presented as a list on the management board, milestones are presented as cards in the roadmap list, and initiatives are presented as checklist items on the milestone cards. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) is attached to the upcoming milestone.

Initiatives are the steps to reach a milestone on the roadmap. Initiatives correspond to a board, or a group of boards on Trello. Initiatives are set as board description.

Epics are lists on boards. Epics contribute to initiatives, and relate to products (e.g. blog, or Guide).

Stories are cards. stories make up epics. Stories are broken down to tasks. Stories are mirrored into the product backlog list, and selected stories are moved to the sprint backlog during sprint planning. Stories have "effort", "value", and "story point" (value over effort) estimates. If the story point is too high, consider turning it into an epic. Stories are structured as:

`<persona>` wants to `<user goal>`, such that `<optional purpose>`.

Tasks are checklist items on cards. Tasks should take no longer than a few hours of work (relatively low number of story points).

KPIs measure progress towards individual initiatives and overall milestones.

Sprints are time box periods of working on selected stories. A sprint runs for 4 weeks, where a week is set to be 10 working hours. Total available development time per sprint is 40 hours per developer.

Sprint planning sets the sprint goal, selects stories supporting the sprint goal, breaks down stories to tasks, and compares the estimated total effort in hours for completing tasks, to the total working hours available. Stories in the sprint backlog are removed or added depending on the comparison. 

Effort estimation considers the definition of done, i.e. developed, integrated, tested, and documented.
