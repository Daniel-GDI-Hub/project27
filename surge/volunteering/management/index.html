<p>Join the Management &amp; Leadership team.
 We need to plan the future, while coordinating our work in the present.</p>

<p>Members of the management team help with business activities and other key tasks.
Managers lead by example, supporting volunteers of other teams.
Team members can break down  their tasks, and recruit new members to work on these smaller tasks.
By doing so, they can also create new, senior leadership roles in the C-suite of Project27 for themselves.</p>
