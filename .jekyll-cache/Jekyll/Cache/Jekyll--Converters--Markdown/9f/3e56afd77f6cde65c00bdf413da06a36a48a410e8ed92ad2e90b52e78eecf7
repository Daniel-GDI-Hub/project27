<h3><a href="/dancyclopedia/cookbook/fish/2021/01/11/prawn-cocktail.html">Prawn cocktail</a></h3>
<p><p>One of my personal favourites. I’ve tried many prawn cocktails in various places, but none of them were as delicious as mum’s home made version of this starter.</p>

<h3><a href="/dancyclopedia/cookbook/fish/2021/01/11/buzaru.html">Shrimps in tomato sauce (Skampi na buzaru)</a></h3>
<p><p>A Croatian classic, which could be classified as comfort food. Quick to make, and it’s best to dip bread in the thick tomato sauce. Get ready to lick all your fingers.</p>
