  <li>Play music in the kitchen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4cDLqsLBSAIIh2yzwlr0zh?si=Vcwl0hLiR1uJqtTIFw9TpA">I recommend this playlist.</a></li>
  <li>Pore a glass of drink for the chef.</li>
  <li>Finely chop the garlics, and the fresh parsley. Add these to the oil to soften up.</li>
  <li>Add the bread crumbs to the garlic and parsley. To loosen up the mixture, slowly add a bit of white wine and stir. Gradually add the rest of the wine and boil it.</li>
  <li>Drop the scampi into the boiling saucepan, and stir for a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour the tomato passata to the cooking scampi and keep stiring. Season with a bit of salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes while stiring so it does not spit tomato everywhere.</li>
  <li>Serve with bread to dip in the thick sauce.</li>
