  <li>Play music in the kitchen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8Hz7ggLfIQSA?si=vQQQKnhxSw2V2vyih1l7Ig">I recommend this playlist.</a></li>
  <li>Pore a glass of drink for the chef.</li>
  <li>Mix the Mascarpone with 100 grams of sugar.</li>
  <li>Use the other 100g of sugar, to whisk the egg yolks into a thick cream. While whisking, add the vanilla sugar. When creamy, add the cinnamon.</li>
  <li>Pour the two separate mixtures into one bowl, and whisk them together well.</li>
  <li>Prepare a black coffee into a bowl, and take the dish in which youâ€™ll prepare the tiramisu.</li>
  <li>Submerge the lady fingers (sponge fingers) into the coffee one by one, for 1-2 seconds. Layer the soaked fingers at the bottom of the dish.</li>
  <li>Once the first layer is complete, spread the half of the Mascarpone cream. Add another layer of soaked lady fingers, and a second layer of cream on top.</li>
  <li>Cover the dish with cling film, and leave it in the fridge for over night.</li>
  <li>Serve with a bit of coco powder on top.</li>
