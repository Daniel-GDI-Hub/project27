<p>The project is split into two parts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The blog, and</li>
  <li>the Dancyclopedia.</li>
</ul>

<p>The TWIST blog provides life style articles on living with a vision impairment. The LogBook on the other hand, does what it says. It keeps a log of issues encountered, snippets of problems and solutions while developing the content.</p>

<p>The Dancyclopedia is what I think about as an educational, web journal. Initially, six volumes form part of the journal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mathematical and physical sciences hub;</li>
  <li>Computer literacy hub;</li>
  <li>Haptics hub;</li>
  <li>Statistics hub;</li>
  <li>Cookbook; and</li>
  <li>Vocal.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mathematical and physical sciences hub (MPS) is a collection of scribbles on mathematical and physics content, organised into distinct issues, or chapters. This volume exists to develop universally accessible content that relies on the heavy use of mathematical notation and diagrams. We also must understand what the laws of nature allow and forbid to tell whether we can or can not do something. Remember:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the laws of nature allow it, you can do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The volume on computer literacy exists to offer a collection of handy tips on how to operate a set of tools, such as git for version control, bash for interacting through shell commands, or RMarkdown to produce accessible reports of statistical analysis. What’s common in these scribbles is that they approach the task from the non-visual access point of view. While a high percentage of tutorials describe how to create an RMD report using R Studio (an inaccessible GUI tool), there are not many who give clear instructions on how to do the same through shell commands. These are skills that a blind scientist might find useful. This volume also gives an opportunity to incubate solutions that makes reading computer code a more sophisticated experience for text-to-speech users, for instance auditory syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>The haptics and statistical volumes are a specific set of scribbles on how these two areas of knowledge work, either at the conceptual level, or in practice.</p>

<p>The cookbook volume is nothing more but a collection of recipes. It secured a place because many people live with the assumption that blind people can not cook. Cooking is a passion, and is a great way to nurture human relationships. This volume also serves as a good sandbox for experimenting with semantic language processing. For example, should you hear 10 meters, or 10 minutes when the recipe says cook for 10m?</p>

<p>Finally, the Vocal volume is an album of voices. This is a volume to honour and listen to those who shaped the mixture of identities any one of us is made up of. This volume includes short biographies and recorded interviews with friends and family. The content also gives opportunity to explore solutions around audio editing, techniques of journalism, and the art of listening. All of these can be useful skills for a blind person, even if they do not wish to be part of the science community.</p>
