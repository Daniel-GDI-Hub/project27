<ol>
  <li>Start playing music in the background.</li>
  <li>Pore a glass of drink for the chef.</li>
  <li>Start boiling the rice.</li>
  <li>While the rice cooks, start preparing the minced stew. For this, chop the onions finely, and fry them on lard. When the onions soften, add paprika, according to your taste.</li>
  <li>Now add the minced meat to the stew base and stir it with the paprika covered onions. Add the vegetable stock, preferably in powder form. But you can use a stock cube dissolved in ~20 ml water.</li>
  <li>When the stew seems to be ready, add the boiled rice and stir it in.</li>
  <li>Now grease the baking tray with a little oil. Spread the green beans at the bottom. It should cover the bottom in a coherent layer.</li>
  <li>Load the stew onto the beans, and form a nice layer with it too.</li>
  <li>On top of the stew layer, spread the sour cream, such that it covers all the meat. This is when you can add extra seasoning, such as more salt, pepper, or as I did, a bit of garlic.</li>
  <li>Finally, top it up with another layer of green beans.</li>
  <li>The finishing touch is to add the bred crumbs on top. Potentially, you can make a mix of bred crumbs, cheese and seasoning to sprinkle on top.</li>
</ol>
