<h2 id="call-for-volunteers-and-contributors">Call for volunteers and contributors</h2>

<p>If youâ€™d like to volunteer your time, and learn a new skill, or improve and existing skill you have and I donâ€™t, then please consider helping me.</p>

<p>I just about managed to link up Bootstrap, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages, to kick in the Project27 engine.
However, I havenâ€™t really spent time working on the visual appeal of the site yet.
In part, this is because I can not see the effect of any change Iâ€™d do.
In part, because Bootstrap scares me. So really, the site would benefit from the capable hands of a web stylist, tinkering on visual design.</p>

<h4 id="who-am-i-looking-for">Who am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Somebody, who</p>

<ul>
  <li>wants to get into web design and learn Bootstrap for styling;</li>
  <li>has a creative and artistic mindset;</li>
  <li>catches onto a challenge, and doesnâ€™t let it go until the challenge is solved.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-i-am-looking-for">What I am looking for?</h4>

<p>Some of the ToDo items that Iâ€™d happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating a unique, and consistent character of the site, by:
    <ol>
      <li>populating content with graphical icons, and figures;</li>
      <li>designing and implementing a global colour scheme;</li>
      <li>designing and implementing the type and visual style of UI elements;</li>
      <li>improving the layout of the content.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>enhancing accessibility and usability, by:
    <ol>
      <li>making sure accessibility, and usability are kept in mind when designing the visual styling. For example:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>graphical elements have suitable alternative description, ARIA labels are informative, and UI elements use standard HTML syntax compatible with screen readers.</li>
      <li>The colour scheme has sufficient contrast, and the font size and family is appropriate for low vision users.</li>
      <li>Content layout is convenient to access for people with learning difficulties or motor disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are up for volunteering with tackling some or all of the above challenges, please get in touch with me.</p>

<p>Although Iâ€™ve learnt a lot about using Jekyll since the start of Project27, there are a few issues persisting for longer than Iâ€™d like them to persist.
I track these issues on GitHub, but so far made little progress about resolving the tickets.
If you can help, please do.</p>

<h4 id="who-am-i-looking-for-1">Who am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Somebody, who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has past experience with Jekyll or Liquid, or learns quickly;</li>
  <li>can solve issues I couldnâ€™t, and happy to teach me.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-am-i-looking-for">What am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Some of the ToDo items that Iâ€™d happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding Jekyll solutions of issues I track;</li>
  <li>raising new issues, suggestions of optimisation around the Jekyll structure, and the Liquid syntax currently used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think you can help? Please let me know.</p>
