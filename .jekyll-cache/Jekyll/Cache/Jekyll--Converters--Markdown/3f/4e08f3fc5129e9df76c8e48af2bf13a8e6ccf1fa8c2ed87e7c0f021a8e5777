  <li>Play music in the kitchen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO2piM6c?si=dZHuHcdOQLacrYrR7N5_Yg">I recommend this playlist.</a></li>
  <li>Pore a glass of drink for the chef.</li>
  <li>Slice the pealed cloves of garlic, and the shiitake mushrooms. Clean the tiger prawns if needed.</li>
  <li>Add olive oil in a frying pan, and start frying the garlic and the mushroom a few minutes later. Meantime, boil cooking water for the pasta.</li>
  <li>When the garlic and mushroom starts to soften (1-2 minutes), add the pasta to the water to cook for 6-8 minutes. At the same time, fry the tiger prawns with the garlic and mushroom. After 3-4 minutes, flip the tiger prawns on their other side, so they fry equally. When the pasta has cooked, and prawns have fried, take prawns off the hob to avoid over cooking.</li>
  <li>When the pasta has cooked, and the prawns have fried, mix the pasta in a bowl with the cream cheese, and the wild garlic pesto. Do it while hot, and add a bit of the cooking water, or olive oil to make the pasta more juicy, preventing it from sticking.</li>
  <li>When the pasta has been mixed, serve it on a plate, than top it up with a handful of rucola and a handful of halfed cherry tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Scoop a couple of prawns onto it, adding a bit of the mushroom and garlic too.</li>
  <li>Enjoy the meal with a glass of white or rose wine.</li>
