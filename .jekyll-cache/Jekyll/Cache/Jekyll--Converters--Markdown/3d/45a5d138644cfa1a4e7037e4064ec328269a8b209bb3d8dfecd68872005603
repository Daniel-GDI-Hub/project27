  <li>Pore a glass of drink for the chef.</li>
  <li>Heat the stock in a small pan and keep it gently simmering.</li>
  <li>Heat the butter and olive oil in a large pan. Add the finely chopped onion and crushed garlic, and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring, until softened.</li>
  <li>Using a wooden spoon, stir in the rice and coat it with the buttery onions.</li>
  <li>Add the wine and simmer until almost evaporated.</li>
  <li>Stir in the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a ladleful of hot stock. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stock has been absorbed into the rice.</li>
  <li>Continue adding the hot stock a ladleful at a time, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes total or until the risotto is tender and creamy.</li>
  <li>For the last 2 minutes of cooking, stir in 250g cooked, peeled prawns and 200g peas (thawed, if frozen, by putting them into a colander and pouring boiling water over).</li>
  <li>When the risotto is done, stir in the herbs, then season to taste.</li>
  <li>Serve with Parmesan cheese shavings scattered over the top.</li>
