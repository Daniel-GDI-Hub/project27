<h3>Complex numbers</h3>

<p>Complex numbers are useful abstract quantities that can be used in calculations and result in physically meaningful solutions.</p>

<h3>Differential equations</h3>

<p>A differential equation is an equation that contains one or more functions with its derivatives. The derivatives of the function define the rate of change of a function at a point. The main purpose of differential equation is the study of solutions that satisfy the equations, and the properties of the solutions.</p>
