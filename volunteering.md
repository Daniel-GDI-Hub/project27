Come and help Project27, and Project27 will help you.

## Call for volunteers and contributors

If you'd like to volunteer your time, and learn a new skill, or improve and existing skill you have and I don't, then please consider helping me.

### 1. Web stylist - a. k. a. Bootstrap guru

I just about managed to link up Bootstrap, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages, to kick in the Project27 engine.
However, I haven't really spent time working on the visual appeal of the site yet.
In part, this is because I can not see the effect of any change I'd do.
In part, because Bootstrap scares me. So really, the site would benefit from the capable hands of a web stylist, tinkering on visual design.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who

+ wants to get into web design and learn Bootstrap for styling;
+ has a creative and artistic mindset;
+ catches onto a challenge, and doesn't let it go until the challenge is solved.

#### What I am looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ creating a unique, and consistent character of the site, by:
 1. populating content with graphical icons, and figures;
 2. designing and implementing a global colour scheme;
 3. designing and implementing the type and visual style of UI elements;
 4. improving the layout of the content.
+ enhancing accessibility and usability, by:
 1. making sure accessibility, and usability are kept in mind when designing the visual styling. For example:
  * graphical elements have suitable alternative description, ARIA labels are informative, and UI elements use standard HTML syntax compatible with screen readers.
  * The colour scheme has sufficient contrast, and the font size and family is appropriate for low vision users.
  * Content layout is convenient to access for people with learning difficulties or motor disabilities.

If you are up for volunteering with tackling some or all of the above challenges, please get in touch with me.

### 2. Back-end engineer - a. k. a. Jekyll guru

Although I've learnt a lot about using Jekyll since the start of Project27, there are a few issues persisting for longer than I'd like them to persist.
I track these issues on GitHub, but so far made little progress about resolving the tickets.
If you can help, please do.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with Jekyll or Liquid, or learns quickly;
+ can solve issues I couldn't, and happy to teach me.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ finding Jekyll solutions of issues I track;
+ raising new issues, suggestions of optimisation around the Jekyll structure, and the Liquid syntax currently used.

Think you can help? Please let me know.

Thanks really, I'm so cool, couldn't live without myself. However, I'd rather praise the awesome volunteers on board of Project27.
