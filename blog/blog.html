    <h1 class="cover-heading">Scribbles on the scribbles</h1>
<p>The blog of Project27 is split into two sections: TWIST and the Project log. Both sections are themed around science, accessibility, and life style, but from slightly different angles.    </p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Project log of Project27</h3>

<p>Project log is a set of scribbles on topics that I found worth mentioning in context of developing Project27. These topics mainly focus on working with MathML, LaTeX, and web content authoring tools, such as markdown. A cross platform evaluation of mathematical content accessibility is a key objective of the project log.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">TWIST: The way I see it</h3>

<p>TWIST is a set of scribbles on various life events and the way I see them. The key objective of TWIST is to collect a set of life style articles in a subjective manner, from a blind scientist and science communicator's point of view.</p>
