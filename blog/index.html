    <h1 class="cover-heading">Scribbles on the scribbles</h1>
<p>The blog of {{ site.brand }} is split into two sections: LogBook and TWIST. If LogBook is the objective point of view, then TWIST is definitely the subjective one.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">LogBook</h3>

<p>The LogBook is a set of scribbles on topics that I found worth mentioning in context of developing {{ site.brand }}. These topics mainly focus on working with MathML, LaTeX, and web content authoring tools, such as markdown. A cross platform evaluation of mathematical content accessibility is a key objective of this branch.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">TWIST: The way I see it</h3>

<p>TWIST is a set of scribbles on various life events and thoughts that cross my mind. These notes are subjective, written in what I'd hope to be an engaging style.</p>
