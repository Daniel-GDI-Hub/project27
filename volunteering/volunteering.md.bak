## Why would I volunteer to contribute to Project27?

**Do it for yourself.**

{% capture benefit1 %}
Project27 is all about learning new skills, and getting better in doing certain things, by practicing, and innovating.
The project offers a wide range of skills to pick up and nurture, and you get to choose which is most valuable to you.
All that Project27 volunteering roles do, is setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) targets for you to work towards.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture benefit2 %}
In the process of learning, you are also contributing to a shared vision.
You could learn on your own, and practice through your personal project.
Wouldn't it be more satisfying though, to help other people in the process?
There are no deadlines, no punishment if something doesn't work out.
It's learning through trial and error, and practice.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture benefit3 %}
 Vibrant teams maintain a friendly vibe.
 There will be opportunities to be social by both digital and physical ways.
 Turn up for every, or every fifth team checkin.
 Stay for an hour, or drop in for only ten minutes.
 Being socially proactive is not a must, only an opportunity.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture benefit4 %}
Are you the collector type, gathering and displaying credits, kudos,, acknowledgements, thanks, and all that jazz?
Then you'll also get the rewards on the <a href="./wall-of-fame.html">public Project27 wall of fame,</a> as well as in the inner circle of Project27.

## How much time should you commit?

The level of engagement is flexible. You may

+ identify, or ask me for a single challenge, solve it, and you are done.
+ continue working on multiple challenges, whenever you find time, even if only a couple hours in a month.
+ get hooked, and if you have nothing better to do, treat it as a part time role.
