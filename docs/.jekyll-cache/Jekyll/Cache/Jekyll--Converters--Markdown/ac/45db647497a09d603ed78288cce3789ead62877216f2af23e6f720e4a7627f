<p>On the small scale, Project27 is a private, digital notebook on a range of topics that matter to the author.
It is a hobby activity, an opportunity to learn skills in web development, accessible content creation, audio editing, revising notes on physics and statistics, capturing and sharing life stories and recipes, expressing opinions and much more. .</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-modest-project27-vision">What’s the modest Project27 vision?</h3>

<p><strong>To be an accessible private pocket resource of apparent challenges and empowering solutions.</strong></p>

<p>The vision of Project27 is based on</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>book trilogy, written by Douglas Adams.</p>

<p>In the modest vision, the Project27 Guide is thought of as a digital notepad, which has solutions to challenges that have already been encountered by the author.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-modest-project27-mission">What’s the modest Project27 mission?</h3>

<p><strong>To provide a corpus of organised accessible notes on topics of personal interest.</strong></p>

<p>The Project27 motto states that the project is A warehouse of challenges and solutions..
While warehouse is an easier term to relate to, a more appropriate description of the project would be that it is a corpus of challenges and solutions.
In dictionary terms, a corpus is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“a collection of written texts, especially the entire works of a particular author or a body of writing on a particular subject.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this sense, the mission statement reflects the desire to collect and organise the notes of the author into a single collection of written documents.
Content is edited and organised according to Project27 content and review guidelines, with special emphasis on universal accessibility.</p>
