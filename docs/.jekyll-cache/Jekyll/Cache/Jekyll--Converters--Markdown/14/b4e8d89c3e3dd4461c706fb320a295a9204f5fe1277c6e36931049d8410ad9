I"y<p>Recently I <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_hajas/status/978362141416808448">Tweeted</a>  about my <a href="http://www.victa.org.uk/driving-break-2018/">VICTA Driving Break</a> trip to Thetford (England) saying something along the lines of “Difficult to sum up this fantastic weekend in 280 characters…”. It was one of those weekends you just have to experience, enjoy and appreciate without any sentimental overkill. But while jotting down a note to preserve a written format of the incredible memories, I thought I might as well provide some food for thought with regards to topics like fear, obstacle, disability, and a dozen other human virtues that were concentrated into a high density in a few days at the {Thorpe Woodlands adventure Centre](www.thorpewoodlands.co.uk/) – the place I once referred to as “the middle of nowhere, and edge of rational thinking”.</p>
