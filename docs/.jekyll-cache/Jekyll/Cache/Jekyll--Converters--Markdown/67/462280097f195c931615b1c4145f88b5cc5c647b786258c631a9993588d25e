I"x<p>Could you enhance the site structure under the hood using Jekyll? Do you have ideas on how to improve the code written in Liquid syntax?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
Although I’ve learnt a lot about using Jekyll since the start of Project27, there are a few issues persisting for longer than I’d like them to persist.
I track these issues on GitHub, but so far made little progress about resolving the tickets.
If you can help, please do.</p>

<p>Somebody, who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has past experience with Jekyll or Liquid, or learns quickly;</li>
  <li>can solve issues I couldn’t, and happy to teach me.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-am-i-looking-for">What am I looking for?</h4>

<p>Some of the ToDo items that I’d happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding Jekyll solutions of issues I track;</li>
  <li>raising new issues, suggestions of optimisation around the Jekyll site structure, and the Liquid syntax currently used;</li>
  <li>researching ways to optimise the code base and build for change, including future requirements and features.</li>
</ul>
