<h3>Prawn cocktail</h3>
<p><p>One of my personal favourites. Iâ€™ve tried many prawn cocktails in various places, but none of them were as delicious as mumâ€™s home made version of this starter.</p>

<h3>Shrimps in tomato sauce (Skampi na buzaru)</h3>
<p><p>A Croatian classic, which could be classified as comfort food. Quick to make, and itâ€™s best to dip bread in the thick tomato sauce. Get ready to lick all your fingers.</p>
