<h3 id="welcome-letter-by-daniel">Welcome letter by Daniel</h3>

<p>Welcome, my name is Daniel, and the Project27 vision is my vision too.</p>

<p>I was born in 1994 with healthy eye sight.
However, I do not remember what it was like to see perfectly.
I was very young when my sight started to deteriorate.
By the age of sixteen, I was completely blind.
Yet, with invaluable support from family, friends, teachers, innovators and technological advances, I was able to live for my passion - science, and maintaining human relationships.</p>

<p>I graduated as a theoretical physicist.
I went on and enrolled to study for a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically haptic interaction, applied to the field of science communication.
I am fortunate to have many valuable friends and colleagues.
I live independently in England, United Kingdom, and speak english as my second language on daily bases.</p>

<p>It was not easy to come so far.
I consider myself incredibly lucky, and merely clever.
I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now, without all the support I received, and now it is time for me to start returning the favour for anyone who might benefit from it.
This is why I created Project27, which is a place where I can start offering my support.</p>

<p>The Project27 Blog is where I express my opinion, insights, and experiences.
The Blog serves two purposes.</p>

<p>Firstly, to log things I learn during the development of this project, since learning never ends.
I started this project to help others, but also to carry on improving my own skills.</p>

<p>Secondly, I‚Äôd like to hint a key notion through the TWIST series.
A person is a set of identities.
As a good friend of mine once said, ‚ÄúDaniel, you are 50 shades of Daniel‚Äù.</p>

<p>I want to show that, a scientist is not just a ‚Äúscientist‚Äù.
A blind person is not just a ‚Äúblind‚Äù person.
I want to show, through my journey what any blind person can do if they find the way.
A blind person can cook delicious meals, a blind person can study and work in sciences, a blind person can be active in journalism and audio editing.
A blind person can also learn to programme, study human psychology, and perform statistical analysis for data science.</p>

<p>Some of these life style stories will come through the pipeline of the TWIST blog, and some through scribbles of the Project27 Guide.
If the Blog is where I offer food for thought, then the Guide is where I wish to help people get things done.
My solutions are not the only path, but they are the ones that helped me overcome challenges; let it be a question in performing a scientific task, or a matter of lifestyle.</p>

<p>The Guide is a first small step in offering descriptions of ways to do things, even if one lives with a vision impairment.
However, as Project27 evolves, I foresee the possibility of offering a more personalised support to individuals with sight loss and their families.
This might happen through online meetings or in person, in forms of tutorial sessions, hands on workshops, or simply a friendly discussion of opportunities and challenges.</p>

<p>There is one common aspect of all the content within the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project27 is a warehouse of challenges and solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I truly wish that the content and the spirit of Project27 will become not only my own, but a shared vision of many.</p>

<p>So long, all the best!<br />
Daniel</p>

<h3 id="biography-and-achievements">Biography and achievements</h3>

<p>Let me introduce where I came from, what study and career path I‚Äôve taken, and what causes interest me.</p>

<h4 id="study-and-career-path">Study and career path</h4>

<p>I was not always sure where life will take me, but I always followed my passion.</p>

<h5 id="path-to-university">Path to university</h5>

<p>I was born in Hungary, where I lived my childhood. Prior to moving to Brighton (England) in 2013, I also lived eight years in Zagreb (Croatia). This is where I completed my secondary school education and obtained my diploma from the <a href="https://www.ibo.org">International Baccalaureate.</a> I studied in a highly international community, and started to develop an interest in sciences, such as mathematics and fundamental physics. In 2010 due to medical conditions I lost my sight.</p>

<h5 id="path-to-research">Path to research</h5>

<p>In 2017 I graduated with a first class honours, Master of theoretical physics degree. Although fundamental physics studies was very satisfying and a great opportunity to acquire skills for solving problems, I also developed an interest in touch technologies. This has led to my current research interest in Human COmputer Interaction (HCI) and haptic interfaces in context of science communication. As a transition from my undergraduate to PhD studentship, in my master year I focused on a science communication project under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p114410-kathy-romer">Prof Kathy Romer.</a></p>

<p>Between 2017 and 2021 I have completed a PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/marianna-obrist">Prof marianna Obrist</a> at the <a href="https://multi-sensory.info">Sussex Computer-Human Interaction (SCHI)</a> laboratory.</p>

<h5 id="path-to-employment">Path to employment</h5>

<p>During my studies, I have had numerous paid employment experiences too.</p>

<h6 id="research-placement-at-ultraleap-ltd-october-2020--december-2020">Research placement at Ultraleap Ltd (October 2020 ‚Äì December 2020)</h6>

<p>I worked for <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com">Ultraleap Ltd</a>, the company funding and supporting my PhD studies, for the duration of a contracted research placement. I joined the research team, investigating haptic perception and haptic technology. My role involved designing and running user studies on improved haptic icon recognition, based on some of my own prior research findings. I was also tasked with supporting various working groups across the company to implement research outcomes in product solutions.</p>

<h6 id="co-founder-and-ceo-of-grapheel-ltd-september-2014--october-2019">Co-founder and CEO of Grapheel Ltd (September 2014 ‚Äì October 2019)</h6>

<p>After carrying out undergraduate research related to the concept of a tactile graphics Display to assist visually impaired science students, I developed the grapheel.com project (2014). The initiative matured into a scalable not-for-profit start-up, managed by five core team members (2017). Grapheel incorporated an R&amp;D scheme for tangible and haptic technologies; a Consultancy and Training scheme; and a Web Service. The mission of Grapheel was to advocate for accessible STEM education for the visually impaired.</p>

<h6 id="consultant-at-it-foundation-for-visually-impaired-march-2016--october-2017">Consultant at IT Foundation for Visually Impaired (March 2016 ‚Äì October 2017)</h6>

<p>I worked for the ‚ÄòIT Foundation for Visually Impaired‚Äô (<a href="http://infoalap.hu/english/">Infoalap</a>, a Hungarian charity) as an Accessible STEM consultant and assistant software developer. My role was to assist a team of programmers in converting <a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> and MathML source documents into audio and braille formats. Prior to this contracted work, I volunteered to test and enhance mathematical features of <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">FS JAWS</a> 17.0, one of the most advanced screen readers. As a result of my work, for the first time in Hungary, users of JAWS were able to fully and correctly access mathematics. I also authored a 70 pages training booklet on ‚ÄòUsing LaTeX for accessible maths‚Äô.</p>
