<h3>1. Nachos</h3>

<p><p>This snack reminds me of our local pub, where we met up with friends on Sunday to listen to live jazz, and munch on nachos. Keep it live!</p>

<h3>2. Vietnamese spring rolls</h3>

<p><p>A roll for every season, let it be spring or summer. The wife of a Vietnamese colleague makes these amazing spring rolls, so I had to try it myself. Crispy, delicious, and you can easily eat one too many.</p>
