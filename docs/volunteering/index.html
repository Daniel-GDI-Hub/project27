<h2 id="volunteering-together-we-learn-together-we-grow">Volunteering: Together we learn, together we grow</h2>

<p>Get involved!
Volunteer to work with the Project27 team, and learn through hands-on tasks.
By doing so, you will also teach those who want to learn, but are not yet ready to roll their sleeves up.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-i-volunteer-to-contribute-to-project27">Why would I volunteer to contribute to Project27?</h2>

<p>Volunteer for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We need your help. We are not experts or professionals in everything that’s needed to keep Project27 up and running. There is a lot to do, so a helpful hand is always appreciated.</li>
  <li>Do it for yourself. We can guarantee, you will learn something new and useful. Benefits include:</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Learn new skills, or improve your existing skills.<div id="volunteer1"></div><div id="morevolunteer1">
Project27 is all about learning new skills, and getting better in doing certain things, by practicing, and innovating.
The project offers a wide range of skills to pick up and nurture, and you get to choose which is most valuable to you. All that Project27 volunteering roles do, is setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) targets for you to work towards.
</div>
<button onclick="readMoreVolunteering1()" id="Read-More-BTN1">Read more</button>
</li>

<li>
Use your knowledge and productivity output to help others.<div id="volunteer2"></div><div id="morevolunteer2">
In the process of learning, you are also contributing to a shared vision.
You could learn on your own, and practice through your personal project.
Wouldn't it be more satisfying though, to help other people in the process?
There are no deadlines, no punishment if something doesn't work out.
It's learning through trial and error, and practice.
What we build together, ultimately helps communities of blind or learning disabled people.
</div>
<button onclick="readMoreVolunteering2()" id="Read-More-BTN2">Read more</button>
</li>

<li>
Be part of a team. <div id="volunteer3"></div><div id="morevolunteer3">
 Vibrant teams maintain a friendly vibe.
 There will be opportunities to be social by both digital and physical ways.
 Turn up for every, or every fifth team checkin.
 Stay for an hour, or drop in for only ten minutes.
 Being socially proactive is not a must, only an opportunity.
</div>
<button onclick="readMoreVolunteering3()" id="Read-More-BTN3">Read more</button>
</li>

<li>
Satisfy your dopamine with an extra reward. <div id="volunteer4"></div> <div id="morevolunteer4">
Are you the collector type, gathering and displaying credits, kudos,, acknowledgements, thanks, and all that jazz?

Then you'll also get the rewards on <a href="/about/team/index.html">our team page,</a> as well as in the inner circle of Project27.

<h2 id="how-much-time-should-you-commit">How much time should you commit?</h2>

<p>The level of engagement is flexible. You may</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify, or ask us for a single challenge, solve it, and you are done.</li>
  <li>continue working on multiple challenges, whenever you find time, even if only a couple hours in a month.</li>
  <li>get hooked, and if you have nothing better to do, treat it as a part time role.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="certified-pathways-of-volunteering">Certified pathways of volunteering</h3>

<p>We are committed to certifying your contributions. Currently, we offer the following achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trainee: after successful completion of 4 tasks (~16 hours of commitment);</li>
  <li>Apprentice: after successful completion of 16 tasks (~16 hours of regular commitment per week, for one month);</li>
  <li>Intern: after successful completion of 48 tasks (~16 hours of regular commitment per week, for three months);</li>
  <li>Active volunteer: after successful completion of 100 tasks (~8 hours of regular commitment per week, for one year)</li>
</ul>

<p>Active volunteers will be considered for part-time employment at Project27 or one of our partners; subject to funding and the legal constitution of the Project27 community interest company in 2024.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-i-apply-to-volunteer">What happens after I apply to volunteer?</h2>

<p>We follow a three step process to ensure you have a great experience of joining the team.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction: We organise a virtual meeting with you to make introductions, understand your interests, and discuss the tasks you would like to help with.</li>
  <li>Onboarding: During your first week, we ask you to complete our onboarding workflow, which involves reading through our ‘getting started’ package, a 30 minute virtual meeting to get you familiar with our systems, and another 30 minute to set you up on your first task.</li>
  <li>Supervision: During the first month with us, we offer two hours of <a href="/support/pricing.html">supervision support</a>, to make sure you can give us feedback, ask questions, and to help you combat initial difficulties.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="volunteering-opportunities">Volunteering opportunities</h2>

<p>We do it all.
And we can’t wait to find people who do some of our tasks much better than we do.
We don’t have roles, we work on tasks.
As such, we adopted <a href="https://mentorphile.com/2019/03/05/fostering-apples-culture-of-accountability-the-dri/">Apple’s Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) way of working.</a>
Everyone in the team is directly responsible for the task assigned to them.</p>

<p>Still interested in volunteering?
We are ready to delegate.
The following tasks are waiting for you to take.</p>
