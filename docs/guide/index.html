<blockquote>
The {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }} is a set of descriptive notes on how to do tasks, I once knew how to do. Sadly, unless practice follows learning, all knowledge fades. - Daniel hajas
</blockquote>

<p>The key aim of {{ site.product }} is to offer a quick reference in unpracticed tasks, organised into specific topics.
Its additional aims are to revise, study, research, innovate, and make aware.</p>

<h3>Mathematical and Physical Sciences</h3>

<p>Editing the MPS volume is a good opportunity to</p>
<ol>
<li>
revise the author's knowledge on physics;
</li>
<li>
organise previously written notes on mathematics and physics
<ul>
<li>
into sections and chapters, which make more structural sense, than the original organisation of notes, and
</li>
<li>
 according to {{ site.brand }} guidelines;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
research, experiment with, and log ways of writing scientific notation in accessible formats.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Computer literacy</h3>

<p>Editing the Computer literacy volume is a good opportunity to</p>

<ol>
<li>
organise "how to" notes on various topics of computer literacy,
</li>
<li>
provide specific guidance and alternative solutions for screen reader users, where available online resources are not considering accessibility.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>Understanding the calculations of statistics, and being able to perform statistical analysis may be useful in most experimental branches of science, for example psychology, sociology, computer science, or any branch of natural science. Editing the Statistics volume is a good opportunity to</p>
<ol>
<li>
study how statistical methods work at the mathematical and conceptual level;
</li>
<li>
practice statistical analysis using the open source program "R";
</li>
<li>
share guidance on how to use R-markdown to interact with R in accessible ways.
</li>
</ol>
