<p>Welcome, my name is Daniel, and the Project27 vision is my vision too.</p>

<p>I was born in 1994 with healthy eye sight.
However, I do not remember what it was like to see perfectly.
I was very young when my sight started to deteriorate.
By the age of sixteen, I was completely blind.
Yet, with invaluable support from family, friends, teachers, innovators and technological advances, I was able to live for my passion - science, and maintaining human relationships.</p>

<p>I graduated as a theoretical physicist.
I went on and enrolled to study for a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically haptic interaction, applied to the field of science communication.
I am fortunate to have many valuable friends and colleagues.
I live independently in England, United Kingdom, and speak english as my second language on daily bases.</p>

<p>It was not easy to come so far.
I consider myself incredibly lucky, and merely clever.
I wouldn’t be where I am now, without all the support I received, and now it is time for me to start returning the favour for anyone who might benefit from it.
This is why I created Project27, which is a place where I can start offering my support, alongside like-minded, talented volunteers.</p>

<p>The Project27 Blog is where I express my opinion, insights, and experiences.
The Blog serves two purposes.</p>

<p>Firstly, to log things I learn during the development of this project, since learning never ends.
I started this project to help others, but also to carry on improving my own skills.</p>

<p>Secondly, I’d like to hint a key notion through the TWIST series.
A person is a set of identities.
As a good friend of mine once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Daniel, you are 50 shades of Daniel”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to show that, a scientist is not just a “scientist”.
A blind person is not just a “blind” person.
I want to show, through my journey what any blind person can do if they find the way.
A blind person can cook delicious meals, a blind person can study and work in sciences, a blind person can be active in journalism and audio editing.
A blind person can also learn to programme, study human psychology, and perform statistical analysis for data science.</p>

<p>Some of these life style stories will come through the pipeline of the TWIST blog, and some through notes of the Project27 Guide.
If the Blog is where I offer food for thought, then the Guide is where I wish to help people get things done.
My solutions are not the only path, but they are the ones that helped me overcome challenges; let it be a question in performing a scientific task, or a matter of lifestyle.</p>

<p>The Guide is a first small step in offering descriptions of ways to do things, even if one lives with a vision impairment.
However, as Project27 evolves, I foresee the possibility of offering a more personalised support to individuals with sight loss and their families.
This might happen through online meetings or in person, in forms of tutorial sessions, hands on workshops, or simply a friendly discussion of opportunities and challenges.</p>

<p>There is one overarching theme though.
Project27 is a place for life-long learning.
I learn, so I can create.
I create, so I can discover new challenges.
I search for solutions of challenges I discovered.
I constantly develop the skills that matter to me.
This is a source of enjoyment, a sense of flow, while I open up employment opportunities.</p>

<p>I truly wish that the content and the spirit of Project27 will become not only my own, but a shared vision of many.
Get involved, to develop skills that matter to you.</p>

<p>So long, all the best!</p>

<p>Daniel</p>
