Could you enhance the back-end Jekyll directory structure and use of Liquid code?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
Although I've learnt a lot about using Jekyll since the start of Project27, there are a few issues persisting for longer than I'd like them to persist.
I track these issues on GitHub, but so far made little progress about resolving the tickets.
If you can help, please do.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with Jekyll or Liquid, or learns quickly;
+ can solve issues I couldn't, and happy to teach me.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ finding Jekyll solutions of issues I track;
+ raising new issues, suggestions of optimisation around the Jekyll structure, and the Liquid syntax currently used.
