### What data do we collect, and how do we handle this?

Presently, {{ site.brand }} only collects data through its application form for volunteers. We may keep a record of names and e-mail addresses of volunteer applicants.

We treat the collected data confidentially, and store data on an encrypted external data storage unit.

### Notices

1. The data collection status and associated privacy statement is subject to change.
2. Please regularly check for updated information on this page.
3. The date of any privacy statement revision will be clearly indicated.
