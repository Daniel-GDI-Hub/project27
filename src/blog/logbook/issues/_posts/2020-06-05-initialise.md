This category is here to house posts about issues and their solutions during the development of {{ site.brand }}. We are learning as we build, so undoubtedly there will be issues to fix. There will be many issues, at pretty much all times.

We want to have a place, where we acknowledge issues, instead of hiding them. These may be issues around accessibility or usability, there may be factual errors in the content, or simply typos, but it may also be that the visual styling of a page or a link is broken.

We use Trello and our scrum workflow to track and work on these issues, we use GitHub to track major issues, and we also want to post them here in a more wordy way. In part, this will help us to log all tracked issues, and make our struggles and solution strategies more visible, more transparent to anyone, who may wish to chip in.

In a later edit of this post, we may add ways to feedback about any issues you identified.
