1. Play music in the kitchen. [I recommend this 
2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.
3. Heat the stock in a small pan and keep it gently simmering. 
4. Heat the butter and olive oil in a large pan. Add the finely chopped onion and crushed garlic, and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring, until softened.
5. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the rice and coat it with the buttery onions. 
6. Add the wine and simmer until almost evaporated.
7. Stir in the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a ladleful of hot stock. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stock has been absorbed into the rice.
8. Continue adding the hot stock a ladleful at a time, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes total or until the risotto is tender and creamy. 
9. For the last 2 minutes of cooking, stir in 250g cooked, peeled prawns and 200g peas (thawed, if frozen, by putting them into a colander and pouring boiling water over). 
10. When the risotto is done, stir in the herbs, then season to taste. 
11. Serve with Parmesan cheese shavings scattered over the top.
