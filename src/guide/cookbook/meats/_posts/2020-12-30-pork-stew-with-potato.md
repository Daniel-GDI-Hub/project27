2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.
3. Chop up the onions finely and chuck it in a frying pan. Add the lard and the speck if available. Start frying.
4. When the onions have gone soft, add the paprika and load the pork shoulders on it. Keep stirring.
5. add a glass of water, and sprinkle 2 pinches of vegetable mix over the stew.
6. Let the pork soften under the lid for about 25 minutes, and top up the water gradually. season with pepper and salt.
7. Meantime, slice up the potato and add it to the stew after 25 minutes. Add enough water such that it covers the potato. Cook them together until the potato goes soft.
8. grate the garlic onto the stew, just before turning the hob off.
