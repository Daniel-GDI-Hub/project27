## Preparation

Here are the steps to cook the meal. {{ page.time }} Share and enjoy!

1. Play music in the kitchen. [I recommend this playlist.]({{ page.music }})
2. Pore a glass of drink for the chef.
3. Slice the pealed cloves of garlic, and the shiitake mushrooms. Clean the tiger prawns if needed.
4. Add olive oil in a frying pan, and start frying the garlic and the mushroom a few minutes later. Meantime, boil cooking water for the pasta.
5. When the garlic and mushroom starts to soften (1-2 minutes), add the pasta to the water to cook for 6-8 minutes. At the same time, fry the tiger prawns with the garlic and mushroom. After 3-4 minutes, flip the tiger prawns on their other side, so they fry equally. When the pasta has cooked, and prawns have fried, take prawns off the hob to avoid over cooking.
6. When the pasta has cooked, and the prawns have fried, mix the pasta in a bowl with the cream cheese, and the wild garlic pesto. Do it while hot, and add a bit of the cooking water, or olive oil to make the pasta more juicy, preventing it from sticking.
7. When the pasta has been mixed, serve it on a plate, than top it up with a handful of rucola and a handful of halfed cherry tomatoes.
8. Scoop a couple of prawns onto it, adding a bit of the mushroom and garlic too.
9. Enjoy the meal with a glass of white or rose wine.
