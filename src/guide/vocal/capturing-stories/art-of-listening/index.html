<h3>Questions</h3>

<h6>Closed questions</h6>
<p>Closed questions have two possible answers depending on how you phrase it:
 “yes” or “no” or “true” or “false.” 
 You can use closed questions to get direct information.</p>

These questions don’t invite “yes” or “no” responses and instead encourage the listener to respond with detail.</p>
