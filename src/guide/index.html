<blockquote>
The {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }} is a set of descriptive notes on how to do tasks, I once knew how to do. Sadly, unless practice follows learning, all knowledge fades. - Daniel hajas
</blockquote>

<p>The key aim of {{ site.product }} is to offer a quick reference in unpracticed tasks, organised into specific topics.
Its additional aims are to revise, study, research, innovate, and make aware.</p>
