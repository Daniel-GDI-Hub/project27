## About {{ site.brand }}

This page introduces the {{ site.brand }} vision and mission, why we do it, who we are, and where we want to be by 2050.

---

### Meet the {{ site.brand }} team

We are Daniel and Danielle, a couple from Brighton, England. We wanted to learn, so we started developing {{ site.brand }}. We live with disabilities, and we have a lot to share.

### Where did {{ site.brand }} begin?

Daniel wanted to collect his science notes from university and his family recipes all in one place. In addition, this library of notes had to be accessible for blind readers, like himself. The library had to be accessible regardless what device it is viewed on; offering the same level of user experience. This quickly turned into an exciting challenge of web development, and gave birth to {{ site.brand }}.

> Welcome, my name is Daniel, and the {{ site.brand }} vision is my vision too.

> I lost my sight at the age of 16. Yet, I live a good life.
I have a doctorate degree in science, I have a healthy social life, and I live independently.
My journey was not easy, but it was doable with support and the right mindset.
So now, I would like to help those who are at the beginning of their journey.
This is why I created {{ site.brand }}.

## What we do

We support people with learning disabilities and visual impairments, by creating a safe space and opportunities for learning.

1. **Active learning**: We promote active learning, by getting volunteers involved with small projects to learn from, while they help with developing the {{ site.brand }} site.
2. **Passive learning**: We enable people to learn using accessible content, by producing a growing library of notes within the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}..

We also support the families, friends, teachers, carers, and mentors of learners by inspiring and consulting.

1. **Sharing thoughts**: We share how we see things with regards to sight loss and learning disability in our blog posts. We do this to lead by example, and inspire anyone who lacks the confidence to learn new skills.
2. **Consulting**: Anyone who needs time to talk things through with us can book an appointment for a session of consulting.

### The modest ambition

{{ site.brand }} is a digital, private notebook on a range of topics that matter to Daniel and Danielle. It is a hobby activity and an opportunity to learn new skills and practice existing ones.

### The grand ambition

However, there exists a vision on the grand scale too: 
**Together we learn, together we teach!**
More people join {{ site.brand }} to learn by getting involved.
The team expands, and new projects are added.
The growth of the library allows more visually impaired and learning disabled people to learn, even if they don't wish to get involved in projects.
The team becomes a community.

### Values and culture

The culture at {{ site.brand }} is defined by four core values:

1. Respect
2. Accessibility
3. Commitment
4. Engagement

[Read more about our values](./values.html)

### What's on {{ site.brand }}?

The site is split into two parts: [Blog](./blog/index.html) and [{{ site.product }}.](./guide/index.html)
Blog posts and {{ site.product }} notes both come in two flavours: technical, and lifestyle.

The blog has two branches:

1. [LogBook](./blog/logbook/index.html) - a technical blog to track challenges and milestones encountered during the development of projects; and
2. [TWIST.](./blog/twist/index.html) - posts on the way we see things.

The {{ site.product }} is what we refer to as the library or the journal.
Initially, five volumes, separated into two collections, form part of the {{ site.product }}.

1. Science collection:
  * [Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS);](./guide/MPS/index.html)
  * [Computer Literacy;](./guide/CL/index.html)
  * [Statistics;](./guide/statistics/index.html)
2. Lifestyle collection:
  * [Cookbook;](./guide/cookbook/index.html)
  * [Vocal.](./guide/vocal/index.html)

#### The roadmap explained

The time between the cornerstone and the first milestone is used to learn, experiment, and set the scene for a scalable project.
Although one of the key objective at the personal level is to learn web development, expanding the R&D team with a professional web developer who is able to innovate through modern technological solutions, would be desirable.

The second milestone introduces the project and its stakeholders to each other, updating product requirements, with a business partner on board.
The PM&BD team is formed.

The third milestone transfers ownership parts of the product to associate editors, and reviewers are recruited to make up the {{ site.brand }} community.
Content is heavily influenced by user requirements.

In the final milestone, the project is community driven, by means of peer-reviewed contributions. Content is managed by associate editors, while the management team looks after sustainability, scalability, and reinvestment in R&D initiatives.

#### Issue tracking

{{ site.brand }} tracks known issues on inaccurate information, as well as known accessibility bugs around the scientific content.
This is done through the GitHub repository and the LogBook posts.
