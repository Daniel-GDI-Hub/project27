## About {{ site.brand }}

We are a mission driven small family business, supporting blind or learning disabled people, and the community around them.

### What we do

We engage in a range of activities to support our mission.

1. **Sharing thoughts**: We share our lived experience of sight-loss, learning disability, and success, through our [blog.]({% link blog/index.html %})
2. **Passive learning**: We enable people to learn about science and lifestyle, by creating accessible articles in the [{{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.]({% link guide/index.html %})
3. **Active learning**: We promote active learning, by [getting volunteers involved]({% link volunteering/index.md %}) in building the [{{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.]({% link guide/index.html %})
4. **Consultancy**: Anyone who needs time to talk things through with us can [book a support session]({% link support/index.md %}) for a session of consulting, tutoring, or mentoring.
5. **Research and innovation**: We work with academic researchers and businesses to push the frontiers of access to science, and disability inclusion.

### Who we are

{% include global/cover-image.html image="founders-cover.jpg" alt="Daniel and Danielle are photographed in the UK Parliament. They are wearing smart clothing. A guide dog is sitting in front of them. In the background multiple signs are visible, such as logos of University College London, World Health Organisation, and GDI Hub. Other signs read 'AT changes lives' and 'Launching the Global Report on Assistive Technology'." %}

We are Daniel and Danielle, a couple from Brighton, England.
We wanted to learn, so we started developing {{ site.brand }}.
We live with disabilities, and we have a lot to share.

### Our history

Daniel wanted to collect his physics notes, and family recipes, in one place. 
He set two conditions for this library:

- notes must be accessible for blind readers, like himself; and
- notes must provide the same user experience regardless what device it is viewed on.

This quickly turned into an exciting challenge of web development.
After Danielle joined the team, we realised that there are many [skills that matter to us.]({% link about/skills.md %})
We wanted to get better at doing certain things, by building {{ site.brand }} bit by bit.
This was always meant to be a private project.
Then, we realised, we can help people, while they help us.

### What's on {{ site.brand }}?

The site is split into two parts: [Blog]({% link blog/index.html %}) and [{{ site.product }}.]({% link guide/index.html %})
Blog posts and {{ site.product }} notes both come in two flavours: technical, and lifestyle.

The blog has two branches:

1. [LogBook]({% link blog/logbook/index.html %}) - a technical blog to track challenges and milestones encountered during the development of projects.
2. [TWIST.]({% link blog/twist/index.html %}) - posts on the way we see things.

The {{ site.product }} is what we refer to as the library or the journal.
Initially, five volumes, separated into two collections, form part of the {{ site.product }}.

1. Science collection:
  * [Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS);]({% link guide/MPS/index.html %}) - a volume of notes on topics of mathematics and physics.
  * [Computer Literacy;]({% link guide/CL/index.html %}) -a volume of notes on how to do small, practical tasks on the computer.
  * [Statistics;]({% link guide/statistics/index.html %})- a volume of notes on how statistical calculations work in a mathematical sense.
2. Lifestyle collection:
  * [Cookbook;]({% link guide/cookbook/index.html %}) - recipes that we enjoy and for you to try out.
  * [Vocal.]({% link guide/vocal/index.html %}) - an album of short stories and audio recordings with family and friends.
