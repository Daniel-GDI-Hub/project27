## About {{ site.brand }}

This page introduces the {{ site.brand }} vision and mission, why we do it, who we are, and where we want to be by 2050.

---

### Meet the {{ site.brand }} team

We are Daniel and Danielle, a couple from Brighton, England. We wanted to learn, so we started developing {{ site.brand }}. We live with disabilities, and we have a lot to share.

### Where did {{ site.brand }} begin?

Daniel wanted to collect his science notes from university and his family recipes all in one place. In addition, this library of notes had to be accessible for blind readers, like himself. The library had to be accessible regardless what device it is viewed on; offering the same level of user experience. This quickly turned into an exciting challenge of web development, and gave birth to {{ site.brand }}.

> Welcome, my name is Daniel, and the {{ site.brand }} vision is my vision too.
>
> I lost my sight at the age of 16. Yet, I live a good life.
I have a doctorate degree in science, I have a healthy social life, and I live independently.
My journey was not easy, but it was doable with support and the right mindset.
So now, I would like to help those who are at the beginning of their journey.
This is why I created {{ site.brand }}.

> {{ site.brand }} is really a warehouse of challenges and solutions.
> I truly wish that the content and the spirit of {{ site.brand }} will become not only my own, but a shared vision of many.

> So long, all the best!

### What we do

We support people with learning disabilities and visual impairments, by creating a safe space and opportunities for learning.

1. **Active learning**: We promote active learning, by getting volunteers involved with small projects to learn from, while they help with developing the {{ site.brand }} site.
2. **Passive learning**: We enable people to learn using accessible content, by producing a growing library of notes within the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.

We also support the families, friends, teachers, carers, and mentors of learners by inspiring and consulting.

1. **Sharing thoughts**: We share how we see things with regards to sight loss and learning disability in our blog posts. We do this to lead by example, and inspire anyone who lacks the confidence to learn new skills.
2. **Consulting**: Anyone who needs time to talk things through with us can book an appointment for a session of consulting.

### What's on {{ site.brand }}?

The site is split into two parts: [Blog](./blog/index.html) and [{{ site.product }}.](./guide/index.html)
Blog posts and {{ site.product }} notes both come in two flavours: technical, and lifestyle.

The blog has two branches:

1. [LogBook](./blog/logbook/index.html) - a technical blog to track challenges and milestones encountered during the development of projects.
2. [TWIST.](./blog/twist/index.html) - posts on the way we see things.

The {{ site.product }} is what we refer to as the library or the journal.
Initially, five volumes, separated into two collections, form part of the {{ site.product }}.

1. Science collection:
  * [Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS);](./guide/MPS/index.html) - a volume of notes on topics of mathematics and physics.
  * [Computer Literacy;](./guide/CL/index.html) -a volume of notes on how to do small, practical tasks on the computer.
  * [Statistics;](./guide/statistics/index.html)- a volume of notes on how statistical calculations work in a mathematical sense.
2. Lifestyle collection:
  * [Cookbook;](./guide/cookbook/index.html) - recipes that we enjoy and for you to try out.
  * [Vocal.](./guide/vocal/index.html) - an album of short stories and audio recordings with family and friends.

### The modest ambition

{{ site.brand }} is a digital, private notebook on a range of topics that matter to Daniel and Danielle. It is a hobby activity and an opportunity to learn new skills and practice existing ones.

### The grand ambition

There exists a vision on the grand scale too: 
**Together we learn, together we teach!**
More people join {{ site.brand }} to learn by getting involved.
The team expands, and new projects are added.
The growth of the library allows more visually impaired and learning disabled people to learn, even if they don't wish to get involved in projects.
The team becomes a community.
The community drives business activities.
The revenue is invested in new research, development, and learning projects.

1. Commitment
2. Accessibility
3. Respect

## Dashboard - The {{ site.brand }} backstage

We have a public dashboard, where we keep the project roadmap, and progress updates on the latest sprint. We like to be transparent, so anyone is welcome to have a quick look. However, the dashboard doesn't meet our user experience, and accessibility standards. Please be forgiving if you decide to view the dashboard.
