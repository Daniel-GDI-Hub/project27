      <h3>Welcome letter</h3>
      <p> Hello, my name is Danielle and I'm working on Project27. 
        I was born in 1993 with a left sided hemiplegia, I am blind in my left eye and I have nystagmus in my right eye. I also have a learning disability. 
        I work with people who have a learning disability and I really enjoy helping other people. 
        While working I discovered I like to create video content and writing articles that people can learn from.</p>

    <div id="CV" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Path to self-advocacy</h3>
      <p>I am Danielle, a young woman with mild learning disabilities. 
        I was an intern at Amaze and also a member of the Power Group (co run by Amaze/Speak Out) 
        where I developed skills and confidence to speak up.  Using skills I learnt at Amaze, 
        I went onto getting a paid job at Speak Out in 2019 as a project worker.
        When lockdown hit, I was working at home with far less support than I was used to in the office
         which is where I really blossomed. I decided to interview people about their experiences of lockdown, 
         creating a series of films called "Speak Out with Danielle". I spoke to a range of people from local 
         people with learning disabilities to the head of Learning Disability England.</p>

    <div id="publications" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Publications</h3>
      <p>I have grown a passion to write, review and share articles on learning disability and self-advocacy.

         + This was my first ever article that has been published in a book.</p>
