              <h2>Path to self-advocacy</h2>
              <p>I am Danielle, a young woman with mild learning disabilities. I was an intern at Amaze and also a member of the Power Group (co run by Amaze/Speak Out) where I developed skills and confidence to speak up.  Using skills I learnt at Amaze, I went onto getting a paid job at Speak Out in 2019 as a project worker.
              When lockdown hit, I was working at home with far less support than I was used to in the office which is where I really blossomed. I decided to interview people about their experiences of lockdown, creating a series of films called "Speak Out with Danielle". I spoke to a range of people from local people with learning disabilities to the head of Learning Disability England.
              I learnt to how to film, edit and publish the films on YouTube on my own initiative. People sheI met on this venture were impressed. I was invited to work on national research about the history of self-advocacy culminating in publishing an article and speaking at national conferences.
              I have also worked alongside other people with learning disabilities to create two films, one about covid and the other about the history of self advocacy. Here is how my boss reflected on my achievements:
              Danielle's remarkable and positive ‘can do’ attitude has opened doors for her to achieve things she never thought possible.
