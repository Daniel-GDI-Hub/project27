## {{ page.title }}

There exists a vision on the grand scale too.
In the long run, the single author corpus is expanded to a collection of peer written and peer reviewed content.
The topics of the product owner's personal interest are expanded to community interest.

### What's the grand {{ site.brand }} vision?

**{{ site.brand }} facilitates learning, teaching, research, and innovation activities in the context of supporting people living with vision impairment in personal development and participation in society.**

This vision statement reflects the belief of where {{ site.brand }} will be in 2050, 30 years after its launch.

In 2050, if a person with vision impairment would like to consume scientific or otherwise technical and professional content, they will be able to do it anywhere, anytime, without any preparation or specialised equipment in addition to their regular choice of assistive technology.
You can compare this with a sighted person today, who sits down on the sofa, brings up the Wikipedia page about special relativity on their internet enabled device, and starts comprehending the content.

For the content to be universally accessible, this will not depend on additional assistive technology or non-standard document formats.
The quality and ease-of-use for technical resources, such as mathematical scripture, graphical information, or multimedia content will be no different from the experience of digital materials used by sighted consumers.

This vision requires three things.
Firstly, a standardised, robust, and compatible system of  markup languages for reliable digital language processing, serving multiple solutions of non-visual communication.  
Secondly, content authoring tools for creating written documents, which are synthesised by existing text-to-speech solutions into natural verbalisations across platforms.  
Thirdly, methods of appending graphical and multimedia content with their non-visual equivalent, such as accessible data visualisations, or audio descriptions of videos.

Standard and robust markup languages, text-to-speech solutions already exist, but with an inconsistent quality of output, which require additional tools to process scripts into natural output.
If {{ site.brand }} finds a way to interface between existing markup languages, develops authoring tools and content through peer-review that is ensuring a high standard of quality across multiple platforms, it really can facilitate learning, teaching, research, and innovation activities supporting people living with vision impairment. 

Unlike other initiatives, {{ site.brand }} focuses on the processes behind content creation, and not on the volume and range of content output. Whilst the {{ site.brand }} is a comprehensive archive of notes and posts, the value is in the activities that led to creating these notes.

<!--
If this vision is hard to believe in, [watch  the Macintosh introduce itself in 1984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY) using text-to-speech solutions, and how far natural language processing and synthetic speech has developed, to become responsive, naturally speaking [voice assistants present in our homes](http://emosamples.syntheticspeech.de). Also, remember that the widely used markup language - [TeX](https://www.tug.org/whatis.html) - was developed throughout the 1980s, with a version usable on personal computers by the early 90s, i.e. roughly 30 years ago.

### What's the grand {{ site.brand }} mission?

**To deliver content and authoring solutions that remove the barriers between scientific, technical, or professional resources and methods of non-visual access to such information.**

This mission statement is how {{ site.brand }} intends to make its vision come true.
If the vision is the destination, the mission is the path selected to arrive at the destination.

The first part of the mission statement states how {{ site.brand }} will facilitate lerning, teaching, research, and innovation activities by 2050.
This is only possible by innovating new solutions that will enable the high quality, universally accessible experience.
Creating a substantial and growing volume of peer-reviewed content is what will enable the vision impaired community and society to adopt the solutions in a wide range of contexts.
Innovation enables the goal, delivery achieves it.

The second half of the mission statement defines the mindset in which solutions should be engineered.
{{ site.brand }} does not want to simply improve the quality of existing solutions, or create a new repository of resources.
Innovation should strive to remove those experiential barriers that prevent processing of scientific, technical, and professional resources by methods of non-visual access to such information.
{{ site.brand }} should minimise the gap between perceived experience, when consuming technical content, by a sighted and a vision impaired person.

Unlike the project vision, the mission of {{ site.brand }},  will evolve as existing technologies and solutions carry on evolving.
