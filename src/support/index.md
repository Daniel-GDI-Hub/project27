## {{ page.title }}

We are here to support those who need it the most. Support sessions are personalised to your needs. For example, we offer

* consultancy - for parents, teachers, carers, disability advisors or whoever wishes to consult us with a specific question in mind;
* tutoring - we can tutor people in topics we endorse in the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}, with an extra portion of attention to accessibility needs;
* mentoring - for those who just need a bit more general guidance, and confidence building.

The information you provide in your support session booking form will help us to find the best person in our team to talk to you.
 
## Book a support session

Use the booking page in the frame below to arrange a time with one of us in the support team. All support  sessions are free of charge; however, there is a booking fee. After the session, we are sending out a short feedback survey to you, where you have the option to 

1. ask for a full refund,
2. convert your booking fee into payment for the support, or
3. to pay an additional sum,

depending how much you value our support. For further details, please read our [terms of service.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link legal/terms-of-service.md %})
