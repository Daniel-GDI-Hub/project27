### Why do we offer personalised support?

We know from experience, written tutorials and guides aren't always enough.
Sometimes we just need a little more hands-on support.
That's why we come to you, listen to your needs and unique circumstances, and why we want to help.

### Who is going to provide the support?

For the time being, you can book a support session with Daniel and Danielle - the core team at {{ site.brand }}.
To learn more about us, check out [our team page]({% link about/team/index.html %}).

The information you provide in your support session booking form will help us to find the best person in our team, or wider community, to talk to you.

### What types of support are available?

Support sessions are personalised to your needs.
We can provide support in the following ways:

* consultancy: for parents, teachers, carers, disability advisors or whoever wishes to consult us with a specific question in mind;
* mentoring; for those who just need a bit more general guidance and confidence building;
* referrals: for those occasions we don't know the solution to your challenges;
* research: for specific questions, where we might need to do a bit of digging to come up with a solution, or a demonstrator tool;
* tutoring: for people, who want to get hands-on and learn new skills in topics we endorse in the [{{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.]({% link guide/index.html %})

You can book a single session. We can also help you plan multiple sessions over a longer period of time. We call this a support period. Have you heard the phrase: ["The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"](https://se-scholar.com/se-blog/2017/6/23/who-said-the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-the-parts)? It's true for {{ site.brand }} support sessions too. During the first session, we can help with creating your personal support period, planning the desired number and type of sessions.

### Where will the session take place?

We are based in East Sussex, England. However, our skills can reach far with the help of the internet. The location of support sessions will depend on the type of support required.

To illustrate where it all happens, let's look at a scenario, with ten sessions in a support period:

* Session 1 (consultancy): an initial in-person session at your home, or remotely over a video call;
* Sessions 2-4 (mentoring): three sessions remotely, over video calls or text messaging;
* Sessions 5-6 (research): two sessions of remote research or demonstrator tool development, with the outputs e-mailed to you;
* Sessions 7-9 (tutorials or training): three sessions in-person at your home, or remotely over video calls;
* Session 10 (referrals): a session in-person at your home, or remotely over a video call with the specialist we think you need to talk to.

Please note:

1. Some sessions, such as training to cook or capture a life story, is best done in-person;
2. In-person sessions are currently limited to East and West Sussex.

### How to book a support session?

Click "book a support session" below, and use our booking page to arrange a time with one of us. All support  sessions are free of charge; however, there is a booking fee.

After the session, we are sending out a short feedback survey to you, where you have the option to 

1. ask for a full refund,
2. convert your booking fee into payment for the support, or
3. to pay an additional sum - depending how much you value our support.

You can book one support session in a calendar month, free of charge. If you'd like more support, we will work with you to plan and schedule a personalised support period. Support periods are a paid for service. For further details, please read our [terms of service.]({% link legal/terms-of-service.md %})
