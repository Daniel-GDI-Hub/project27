## {{ page.title }}

You can book one support session in a calendar month, free of charge, regardless of the type of support. However, you can book as many support sessions as many you need. Additional support sessions are priced according to the price plan below.

If you'd like to set up a regular support plan with a variety of support sessions, we will work with you to build and schedule a personalised skill studio. Skill studios are a paid for service, paid up-front. However, booking a skill studio often comes with discounts.
