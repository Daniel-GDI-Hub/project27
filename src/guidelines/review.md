The key task is to make sure no false, incorrect, or outdated information is published.
The associate editor must aim to nominate a reviewer who has sufficient knowledge in the topic of the content to be reviewed.

The readability review also should ensure the appropriateness of spelling, grammar and all other language requirements.
