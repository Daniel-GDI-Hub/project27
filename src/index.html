<h2>What is {{ site.brand }}?</h2>

<p>
{{ site.brand }} is a place for learning. It is developed by a couple - Daniel and Danielle. The content is drawing on the skills, experiences, and knowledge of the {{ site.brand }} team. Daniel is a scientifically-minded blind person, with an interest in social entrepreneurship. Danielle covers art, and expertly navigates the world of learning disability.

<p>
We tell our insights through blog posts. We teach through the notes of the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}. We involve learners with learning disabilities and visual impairment through the projects of {{ site.brand }}.
