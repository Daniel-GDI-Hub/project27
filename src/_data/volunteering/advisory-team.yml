  role: Systems Advisor
  contribution: Rob and Daniel were colleagues at the Sussex Computer-Human Interaction Lab. Gradually, Rob became one of Daniel's most trusted friends. Rob is a skilful coder, and maker of things. He was a co-founder of OWidgets, a spin-out venture from the SCHI Lab. We are reading and walking pals, often immersed in meaningful conversation over a burger. Rob is an excellent anchor in analysing systems, and asking the right questions. That's why we asked him to be our systems advisor. His role is mainly to review the Project27 systems, as a set of things working together in  a complex whole, and highlight weaknesses, opportunities, and missing links.

  role: Academic Advisor
  contribution: Ron has offered invaluable feedback, academic mentorship, and a tonne of fun, since Daniel met him in 2014. Ron is an academic in informatics at the University of Sussex. His ability to bring clarity to things has always been immensely helpful to Daniel, let it be writing the PhD thesis or applying for a job. When it comes to setting our research agenda, there isn't another person we would trust more than Ron. That's why we asked him to be our academic advisor. His role is to give advice on building the right research pipeline for Project27, and the right interface  with other academic projects.
