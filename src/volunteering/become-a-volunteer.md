## {{ page.title }}

Thanks for your interest in becoming a volunteer. To do so, please download the short application form and e-mail it to us as an attachment. 

<a class="{{ page.buttonStyle }}" href="{{ '/assets/documents/Project27--Application-form-for-volunteers.md' | prepend: site.baseurl}}" download="Project27 - Application form for volunteers">
Download application form
</a>

The application process is very quick and simple, but it is also a small, self-contained challenge. By sending us your completed application form, you show us:

* how committed you are to learning,
* how well you can create an accessible document,
* whether you respect our application process, and
* how engaging your first {{ site.brand }} written piece is.

After we received an application, we will read it, reply to your e-mail, and arrange a call with you to discuss your involvement. If you are still happy to proceed, go ahead. We look forward to welcoming you.
